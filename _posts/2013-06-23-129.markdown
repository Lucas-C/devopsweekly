One area of development that's often been quite separate from the devops movement is front-end engineerings. This post proposes that increasingly there is lots of work for a front-end operations engineer around build processes, performance, measurement and automation.

I mentioned the new Etsy anomaly detection stack Kale, Skyline and Oculus last issue. Here's the presentation which introduced it at Velocity. Lots of details about how it works under the hood and the performance challenges of all those metrics.

Managing risk is an increasingly important thing to understand when building complex systems. This talk, by Johan Bergstrum at the recent Velocity conference, covers What, Where And When Is Risk In System Design.

Packaging software for inclusion in operating systems is often a thankless task, but this post does make some good points about the benefits of more monolithic packages including dependencies over the desire to split everything up.

If monolithic packages are of interest one way of building them is using the Omnibus tool from Opscope, which I've mentioned before. Here's a nice tutorial on how to use it.

A good writeup of the general pattern of immutable servers, launching new instances when changes are required rather than upgrading existing machines. A name might make discussing this idea easier too.

Salmon is an interesting approach to a simple monitoring system that uses the Salt configuration management tool for much of the data.

Testing against non-production environments with real traffic can be tricky. Gor is a new tool that collects and then can replay traffic in real-time against multiple environments, ideal for load testing.

Maintaining a large number of Jenkins jobs using the web based interface can get a little time consuming. This plugin provides a simple domain specific language for defining jobs, making automation much easier.

If you already have a set of configured servers moving to using configuration management tools like Puppet can seem a lot of work. Pysa is a new tool that aims to generate Puppet code based on the existing configuration of a running server. Maybe a good way of seeing value quickly.

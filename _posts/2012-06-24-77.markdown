## Issue 77 - 24th June

I generally find articles on the culture aspects of devops harder to come by, so I was pleasantly surprised to find three excellent related posts this week. Applying scientific methods to asking why devops is a good thing, reading airline accident reports to make you a better systems administrator and why distributed systems require a distributed team are all exactly the type of things I want to read more of.

Excellent detailed blog post about the roots of devops, with lots of focus on the communication and collaboration angle. It applies the scientific method of promise theory to the world of dev and ops and makes a strong argument about why the devops movement is proving successful.

Lists of things to make you a better systems administrator tend to involve learning to code or other technical bits and pieces. This one involves reading airline accident reports and medical case reports. A great argument for seeing how other professionals report on failures with the aim of improving the situation in the future.

Netflix have been talking lots of the technology behind distributed systems recently but this post covers what that means to the people operating the platform. The operations team has moved from a centralised organisation to a more distributed one, embedded within the development organisation.

With the move to infrastructure automation the APIs we use are increasingly important. This post makes a good case for consolidation around existing APIs rather than everyone creating their own.

Excellent looking slide deck on the future of deployment. I'd love to see the talk live or on video as some of the points aren't clear just with the slides but it's still well worth going through.

GitHub are well know for having lots of internally developed tools which do everything from surface monitoring information to deploy code to order pizza. This presentation talks about why and about using tools to raise the proficiency of everyone in an organisation.

Tools

Logstash is a fantastic swiss army knife of a tool that everyone should take a look at. Examples can make getting started easier as well as make common tasks quicker for the already converted. Enter the community cookbook for logstash recipes. Very handy.

Once upon a time the Chef server may have been quite involved to install, but now we have a few very simple tools. Knife-server is a knife plugin which can currently summon a new server with one command. Other upcoming features like backup and restore sound interesting too.

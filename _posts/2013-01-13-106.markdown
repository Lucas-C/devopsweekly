## Issue 106 - 13th January

Devopsdays is coming to London. And Austin. And Paris. And Berlin. And New York. And that's just up until May. London and Austin are now open for registration and looking for talks and sponsors. If you've not yet made it to a devopsdays event (and even if you have) you really shouldn't miss out: http://devopsdays.org/

Now working for the UK Government I've become increasingly interested in the role of auditors and formal accreditation processes in devops. This blog post (and actually the entire blog) looks like a great resource. This post is discussing compensating controls for situations where developers should have access to production.

A good long discussion of the pros and cons of different testing workflows for configuration management. Focuses on Chef but it's worth a read whatever tool you're using. Includes an entire GitHub organisation of tools to investigate.

Dashboards are an important part of monitoring systems and generally knowing what is happening within your system. This post makes the claim that many of these dashboards would be better represented as activity streams, and gives a few examples. I'd certainly like to see something like this for system monitoring data to try out.

A well reasoned blog post all about being on-call. How to organise on-call rotas, what it means to be on-call and more. Looks like the first post in a series too so hopefully more to come.

A write-up of talking some scripts and lists for setting up a new OSX workstation and converting them to use Chef. Two posts this week about configuration management for developer workstations, good to see lots of people doing this and sharing experiences.

Part two of the series I mentioned last week on creating Chef Light Weight Resource Providers, this time focusing on the Resource side of things. Good starting documentation if you're working with Chef.

A simple chef-solo approach to configuring a developer workstation. Has simple configuration for Mint and OSX based systems and might be a good starting point if you're not doing something similar yet.

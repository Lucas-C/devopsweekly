## Issue 85 - 19th August

A relatively quiet issue this week, probably because I'm back at work and suitably busy. Hopefully a little something for everyone; interviews, reading lists, approaches to testing, recruitment and monitoring to name a few. Devops, at least as I see it, really is a broad topic.

The initial set of talks have been announced for devopsdays Rome in October and all of them sound amazing. Early bird tickets still available too.

The question about whether devops is applicable to large, traditional enterprises is interesting and this pretty in-depth question and answer session with lots of smart folks makes for worthwhile reading - especially if you have an interest in large company adoption.

With more and more components and larger systems, an understanding of some of the theory of distributed systems is becoming increasingly useful. This is a useful, if a little dated, reading list that should provide a great start to delving into the topic from both an academic and practical standpoint.

A series of vagrant setups for experimenting with various monitoring tools has also led to a growing rpm package repository of some useful tools including graphite, ganglia and logstash. A good way to get started quickly if you're investigating new tools.

Hiring or at least recruitment is a popular topic in devops circles due I think to a growing demand or at least interest. This post isn't specific to devops but is detailed and interesting, covering lots of reasons for leaving, joining or retaining good technical staff.

A few year ago testing configuration management code was pretty much just an interesting conversation but now we've got lots of tools to make it a reality. This blog post covers a range of tools useful for testing Chef code, as well as a few helpful utilities and tips for the resulting workflow.

Tools
====

Knowing how a given application is using memory, IO and CPU can be useful when debugging problems. Monner tries to make that capability even earlier to access, including during development, be providing a useful command line wrapper that outputs utilisation information.

If you produce relatively complex software that you want to work across a wide variety of different environments then virtual machines are an obvious solution. With vagrant and veewee as the underlying tools, bento is a modular set of basebox definitions used by Opscode. Useful as a starting point if you have similar cross-platform challenges.

## Issue 87 - 2nd September

I checked this morning and this newsletter now has 4000 subscribers. That's a whole lot of people interested in the same topic, especially one some folks complain that no-one can provide a good definition for. I'm seeing more content too from meetups and user groups, which again suggests a real growing community - a big thank you to everyone involved in spreading the word.

Lots of people are working on workflow tooling around the configuration management stack. This example introduces a git hook based mechanism for deploying puppet code to remote servers. It also features some validation of manifests to prevent pushing out invalid code.

The Devops community if filled with people learning more about development or more about systems administration (or more about both). Introductory articles like this 10 things every sysadmin should know are useful both for people new to the field, whether experienced developers or brand new operations folk.

## Issue 73 - 27th May

Lots of "people" content this week, including talk of relationships with other business groups, lists of practices worth implementing, user centred organisations and a laptop made specifically for people like us. Still room for some good technical content too, Buster.JS looks great for anyone doing some high level web testing.

Another good post about he relationship between development, operations and a security function. Some good follow up comments as well, I'd love to see some more case studies around this topic.

Here's a nice list of ideal operations practices as a Gist (already with a couple of forks). Definitely worth reading through and comparing to what you're doing at present - I'd guess for most environments it would help focus on a few areas worth spending time on.

Interesting collaboration between Canonical and Dell to try and make a high quality developer centric laptop. The GitHub powered templates sound interesting, as do some of the other features. Hopefully the 6 month project will bear fruit - I'd love to try something like this when they fix the trackpad issues.

The answer isn't always to automate everything it seems. This post discusses some pros and cons of automating a documentation workflow but the argument stands for most processes.

A good write-up of some of the discussions from GOTO about driving development work from metrics. Mentions why factoring metrics collection into your definition of done is a good idea and has a good example of a simple feature that actually generates lots of useful metrics if we choose the collect them.

One of the presentations that inspired the above blog post, Using monitoring and metrics to learn in development. Some good monitoring sucks material and a few great diagrams of where process improvements could be made.

I work in a very user-centred environment at the moment so this blog post made interesting reading. That we're seeing lots of barriers broken down isn't new, but the lists of why different groups care about items that may have been separate from their silo previous is good.

High level integration testing in browsers can often be somewhat painful, so Buster.JS looks interesting. It's a JavaScript test framework for node and browsers; it supports running tests in local browsers, headless tests, proxying to live websites, and comes with good support for mocks and stubs and other modern testing techniques.

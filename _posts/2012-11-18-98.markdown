## Issue 98 - 18th November

I've been going to FOSDEM (a big open source conference in Belgium) for a few years now, and will be back again next year. One of the highlights is the Configuration Management dev room and the call for proposals is open until the 15th of December. Any ideas for talks can be emailed to config-mgmt-devroom@lists.fosdem.org.

More interesting discussion (and examples) around the best approach to making Chef cookbooks reusable. Getting a balance between concise domain specific code and generic, reusable recipes is hard so more posts like this are great.

A nice run down of open source load testing tools, including apachebench, httperf, jmeter and tsung. The tsung walkthrough, installation and configuration details in particular are of interest if you've not used tsung yet.

Managing firewall rules is never really going to be fun. But this post covers a tool, ript, which aims to provide a nice DSL for maintaining iptables rules. The more interesting parts are in the workflow and the use of migrations in a similar way to a database schema migration tool.

A talk I gave a few months ago all about Infrastructure as Code. Pretty introductory stuff for most readers of this newsletter but hopefully a good starting point for anyone new to the concepts.

Good post from Yammer about how they approached sharding a large Postgres database for a big Rails application. Useful for anyone with similar scaling problems as it nicely focuses on the database rather than the application requirements and tools.

A talk from Ruby Conf a few weeks ago all about the state of ruby application monitoring from the folks at Librato. Discussion of the problem, some examples of solving it and some interesting bits about the monitoring primitives.

Netflix continue talking about and open sourcing the tools they build to maintain Netflix. Edda aims to make understanding how you're using AWS easier, storing information from the API about instances, IPs, security groups, etc. and allowing you to query the changes over time.

Anyone running java (or scala, clojure or jruby) commands from the command line probably knows about the slow startup time. Drip looks an interesting approach to fixing the problem, using a sprinkling of bash, C and Java. Lots of options and well documented.

Nearly every week I include a graphite dashboard or plugin from Jason Dixon (@obfuscurity). This week it's Therry. A simple services that provides a nice http end point for searching through Graphite metrics.

## Issue 131 - 7th July

_I'm speaking at RAMP (http://rampconf.com/) next week in Budapest. Although tickets have already sold out, many of the sessions will be streamed live. Hopefully lots of interesting and relevant content for readers of this newsletter. And if you're going to be at RAMP let me know._

Devops is equally applicable in environments running Windows but the tools available are certainly fewer and less mature. This blog is trying to bring together what works and what doesn't.

Finding people who get devops is proving difficult for most organisations. Hiring is hard. This webcast looks at applying the Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing principles to recruitment - not just to hire good operations engineers to for hiring any skilled in-demand employees.

Erlang is an interesting language for working on systems that are inherently distributed. But it's also quite different to your typical general purpose scripting language. This recent Food Fight Show episode delves into Erlang for a Devops interested audience.

When did you last test your database backups? This post describes an approach called the test environment database refresh pattern which should provide some confidence.

A nice call to action for the ITIL and ITSM community. Devops isn't trying to kill these frameworks, but they would be silly not to look at what's happening and remove some of the perceived blockers they introduce.

Making deployments atomic, and not leaving requests executing old and new code at the same time, is important if you're going to be releasing changes all the time. This post explains how in a PHP and Apache environment to use the web server to make this possible.

A nice list of proactive approaches you can take to improving the security of your web applications. Lots of good lists like this in the security community, but I do wish they got turned into code.

Jobs
====

Mandiant has multiple openings for Mid to Senior Operations Engineers to support the development and deployment of a next generation security analytics platform. The ideal candidate would be a Linux/Python generalist with experience building, scaling, and monitoring data-intensive AWS-based applications. Candidates must have extensive automation and configuration management experience with a preferred specialization in either MongoDB, MySQL, Sphinx, Node.js or a continuous build system such as Jenkins. Operations and Engineering teams are distributed across the US, so candidates may be remote or work from a Mandiant office in the US.

Events
======

Devopsdays events are cropping up all over the world. One of the next ones is due in Tel Aviv on September 30th and October 1st. The call for proposals is open until the 1st of August.

It's never too late to get involved in open source communities. This physical and virtual event is aimed to help anyone get started contributing to Puppet. The focus is on cleaning up issues in Puppet and in Modules and is being held on Saturday 13th of July.

Tools
====

An interesting take on a coding test, in this case aimed at testing system administration and Puppet skills. You can write your own tests but the repo provides the framework.

I'm a big fan of Riemann but getting started with it's configuration, especially if you're not too familiar with Clojure, can be daunting. This published real-world config programme is therefore a great resource.

Lots of tools cropping using Vagrant to make testing configuration management code easier at the moment. Vagrant-cucumber is a plugin which manages snapshots, executing cucumber steps on virtual machines and rolling back to a known state.

## Issue 79 - 8th July

A particularly varied issue this week with web based tools, command line applications, extensive notes from conferences, discussions of workflows and case studies of bug hunts to name a few topics. When folks aren't spending time discussing what devops is (or isn't) everyone is talking about super interesting things.

I've mentioned the online book The Architecture of Open Source Applications before but it's worth doing so again. It's filled with fantastic chapters on interesting technologies. Here's a couple of particular relevant chapters on nginx and puppet that are included in volume 2.

The recent velocity conference had loads of great talks and tutorials, and these notes from both days cover lots of them. Lots of links to both things mentioned and the various slide decks. If you didn't make it well worth a bit of reading time.

Puppet Lint is a command line tool that checks your Puppet code against the style guide from Puppet Labs. Well now it's also been exposed as a web service, allowing files to be uploaded and reports produced. Even more handily it has a GitHub post commit hook to lint public repos when they are pushed.

Interesting article about the relationship between Quality Assurance folks and the devops movement. I'm not sure I agree with all of it but the idea of explicit bugs against practices and processes is not something I'd considered previously.

Nice article on monitoring driven development with Chef. It doesn't give any concrete examples but it does suggest how a before and after workflow and talks about some of the merits of the existing Chef testing tools.

Quick write-up from Mozilla about the leap second bug, how they discovered the problem and how they went about fixing it. Lots of details too in the comments.

Tools

Jclouds is the excellent Java based cloud provider API abstraction library, and the new jclouds command line interface tool looks great. It provides an interactive prompt for managing cloud instances from around 30 different providers or stacks.

Haibu is a node.js application server, which might not be of immediate use to everyone. What is worth looking at even if you're not using node is the interfaces. Everything is available as JSON over HTTP, from restarting applications to deploying new ones.

Barkeep is a very nice looking code review tool which aims to address some of the deficiencies of other similar offerings. In particular it's a post-commit tool rather than the pre-commit approach taken by GitHub pull requests.

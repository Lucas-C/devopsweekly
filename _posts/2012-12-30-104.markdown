## Issue 104 - 30th December

A good few monitoring tools and utilities this week, plus a range of other interesting articles. Next weeks issue might be late as I'll likely be travelling, don't worry if you don't receive it on Sunday.

A counter to the "no devops team" theme, describing the formation of a team to help an existing development and operations team work better together. Best quote "At first I was not sure it was the right name for this team, but now I donâ€™t think it matters".

A couple of interesting and detailed posts from the Indeed engineering team. Both describe the implementation of internal systems, first a log aggregation and next a highly available RPC framework. No code yet but the detailed discussion of the design choices is still interesting.

Etsy reduced the number of different technologies in use starting a couple of years ago. This post covers why they no-longer use Mongo, and how they used MySQL for the application instead. The focus is on the hidden work when using a new system or service.

Good case study of a deployment pipeline for infrastructure components using Puppet. Nicely it covers a previous design and the problems with it, before documenting the final working system.

Another post about how devops fits into the skills and team structure within an organisation. The argument here is that devops, or developer operations, is likely to become a new specialism within larger teams.

A good list of best practices for speeding up software releases. Short descriptions that should be a good starting point for further exploration.

Tools
====

logstash-tail is a nifty utility if you're using logstash. With the addition of a tcp output to logstash, logstash-tail gives you a command line interface to tail filtered logs.

A good addition to the Erlang toolbox, folsomite aggregates folsom metrics from an Erlang process and exports them to either Riemann or Graphite. Good to see more folks using Riemann too.

Graphital is a ruby based tool for shipping system metrics to graphite. It is very easy to extend with scripts in any language, and includes a few sample plugins for common tools and low level metrics.

The Riemann monitoring tool ships with a dashboard as an example of using the API but the tool can be used for different usecases. Riemann-grid is an alternative dashboard written in clojure that might be worth a look.

## Issue 62 - 11th March

The first story this week is the news of the 1.0 release of Vagrant. I just wanted to say a personal thank you to Mitchell and everyone else involved in the development and evangelism of a particularly useful part of mine, and many others, development environment.

A big release this last week, Vagrant has hit 1.0. This is an important release as the format for the Vagrantfile will now be supported for the foreseeable future. The recommended installation method has also changed, with native installers shipping for a large number of different platforms. Huge congratulations to Mitchell Hashimoto and everyone else involved.

Mitchell Hashimoto, of Vagrant fame, has written a nice summary of 2 years hard work on open source software. Lots of good insights and advice for anyone involved or wanting to get involved in open source.

Good lucking presentation about a number of places where operations kills and awareness are particularly useful for developers. Lots of details about approaches to logging, metrics collection, java packaging and more.

An interesting description of the problem with making configuration management code reusable. I have to agree with the general theme, that this is no-where near a solved problem. Some good examples of how traditional object orientated software practices could be applied to the problem too.

Nice writeup from a talk by Gene Kim, author of Visible Ops. Nicely summarising devops, in particular the letters to stakeholders section which has bullet point advice for different groups; developers, testers, operations, designers and product managers.

Testing configuration management code is still in most places a new idea, with new tools and approaches still being worked out. This example I found interesting, it runs a command after a puppet run which runs a series of tests and emails failures. The tests themselves are defined as nagios checks and interestingly defined alongside your puppet resources.

The topic of the future of systems administration appears to be a recurring one, and this post makes a case for specialisation and in particular different types of admin. Makes some point about this being the case now in places and that other industries or shops will move in that direction over time.

Tools
====

I'm seeing more and more tools being built around Graphite, which can only be a good thing. Response acts as a proxy for graphite, and features a plugin system to act on incoming data. The example alerting plugins look interesting.

Guard::Knife looks a handy tool which can automatically trigger knife commands when your Chef cookbook files change. Useful if you find yourself constantly saving and then uploading to your Chef server.

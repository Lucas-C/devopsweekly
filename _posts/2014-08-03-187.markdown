Tools
====

Managing local machines with Vagrantfiles has lots of advantages, but when recreating that environment in production you might turn to something like libcloud. Duplicate no more, with with vagrant driver for libcloud.

Terraform is a tool aimed at giving you a single view of your entire infrastructure in code. Describe instances and supporting services (like DNS) via a domain specific language and use the command line tool to launch across multiple infrastructure providers.

http://www.terraform.io/


Consul is an orchestration mechanism with fault-tolerance based on the gossip protocol and a key/value store that is eventually consistent. Hiera-consul will allow hiera to write to the k/v store for metadata centralisation and harmonisation.

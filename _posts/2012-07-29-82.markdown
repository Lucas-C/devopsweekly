## Issue 82 - 29th July

I think I spent last week in Ruby land going by this weeks links. Software releases, Rails deployment notes, useful libraries and more. It definitely feels like having Ruby in your toolkit is useful, even if it's not your main language for application development.

Various people have been talking about HTTP/2.0 recently in the standardisation community. Worth reading is this response from the Varnish developers about what's wrong with HTTP and why the current proposals don't address the right problems.

Nice summary of ways to clean up Rails deployment workflows, at least for smaller environments. Not too much detail but a goo checklist that's relevant to most environments.

Foreman, the infrastructure management tool, has hit the 1.0 release minestone. Lots of improvements to the user interface as well as experimental support for OpenStack and VMWare environments.

Cinderalla is a fully managed development environment for open source hacking on Mac OSX, managed using homebrew and Chef. It supports a range of languages, databases and other tools and won't stomp on your existing setup.

Understanding HTTP caching is well worth the time investment if you're doing anything on the web. This article contributed to the Heroku knowledge base is a great introduction, and relevant outside Heroku too.

I'm pretty interested in expanding the whole monitoring toolchains we're building to more than operational metrics. Everything from business information to project management data is fair game. Here's an example of getting GitHub commit data into Graphite via a webhook.

Tools

Nice looking open source exception tracking tool that's compatible with the Airbrake hosted service API. Particularly useful if you're in an environment where tracking exceptions in a third party service just won't do.

Ruby has an over abundance of HTTP client libraries but Transport looks pretty useful if you're building API clients. It's quite high level but aims to provide all the common tools you'd need (like timeouts, dealing with headers, deserialisation, etc.) based on some sensible conventions.

Being able to quickly parse log files for useful information is a handy technique, and graphene aims to make that easier without having to remembering regex patterns or sed and awk magic. It also supports generating graphs with very little code.

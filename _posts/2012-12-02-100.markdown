## Issue 100 - 2nd December

100 issues down. I didn't see that coming when I had the idea to write a newsletter. It's pretty interesting to have observed, experienced and participated in the growth of such a vibrant and interesting community around the word Devops. Hat tip to Patrick Debois for starting something huge.

I made it along to the London Devops meetup this week and one of the presentations was all about scaling logstash. Lots of practical hints and tips in the slidedeck that should help you avoid some common and not-to-common pitfalls.

Mitchell Hashimoto, one of the creators of Vagrant, has launched a new company to support and extend Vagrant and to drive the development of the tool and ecosystem. More documentation and the much talked about support for multiple virtualisation backends are on the way.

Great presentation analysing in great detail an AWS outage and concentrating nicely on how complex systems fail, and how failures can be avoided with a little help from W Edwards Deming.

Disqus, the comments as a service folks, recently moved to a more real time approach. Now they did it was interesting through, by writing an nginx module which allowed for long polling. They have open sourced the code as well.

Interesting set of blog posts, describing protocols or patterns for Devops adoption. The first two talk about the advantages of starting small and fixing a real problem quickly and about configuration management and limiting manual changes.

Managing a MySQL master/slave setup can be a little tricky at times. One uncommon but fiddly operation is swapping the role of one of the machines in the cluster. This script does just that, along with lots of checking that everything has worked as intended. Worth reading even just as documentation.

What if Nginx was more an application server than a web server/proxy? Openresty aims to build just that, packaging nginx along with lots of 3rd party modules and dependencies. It lets you build applications using the Lua programming language and already supports backends for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Memcached, and Redis.

Zabbix has a reputation for needing a lot of manual configuration. Recent improvements have made that more easily automatable and zcollective uses those new features to allow for building a host configuration using mcollective.

A nice looking big screen dashboard view for Nagios. As well as auto-refreshing content and having a high visibility design it allow for some limited interactivity for acknowledging problems, scheduling downtime and enabling/disabling notifications.

If you find yourself documenting and running many Knife commands when using Chef then Spiceweasel might be the answer. It allows you to describe in JSON or YAML your Chef setup and then commands to convert that domain specific language to the relevant Knife commands.

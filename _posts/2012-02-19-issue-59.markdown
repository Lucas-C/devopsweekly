## Issue 59 - 19th February

A good week for discussion and debate this last week. In particular the Devops google group suddenly came to life with several worthwhile threads on job titles and organisation names, and whether networking knowledge is a key skill for everyone. If you're not already subscribed then take a look http://groups.google.com/group/devops.

I don't generally include negative content but this Reddit thread has some interesting discussions hidden amongst. The original blog post appears to have disappeared, but what I find most interesting is some of the preconceived ideas about Devops. Knowing some of the arguments against makes making coherent arguments for easier.

The foodfight podcast is back with another episode, this one featuring some FOSDEM roundup, discussions with John E. Vincent and some Chef community news. Worth a listen even if you're not using Chef as the content is broader than just a single tool.

Neat idea for versioning DNS records in Git. The example uses the dnsimple API, but you could do exactly the same with any good DNS provider with an API. Would be nice to see this automated, or maybe even a DNS vendor allow access to records as a git repository.

Lots of talk recently about the use of the word Devops in job titles. This post makes a strong case that, used as a qualifier, it makes perfect sense.

This OASIS standards group are working on a Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications. The aims are portability and interoperable, but the tools being used are XML and large vendors. Depending on your interests it be worth reading through the existing specification for ideas and maybe how concepts are named.

Interesting case study from Fotopedia focused on their use of MongoDB and MySQL. Mainly focuses on what they have learned moving some data from MySQL to Mongo, with details of why they did it and what they liked best.

A nice summary of #monitoring sucks, in response to the idea that it was really just some sort of marketing scheme. Lots of good related links here as well as details of why monitoring really does suck.

Good article focusing on practices for low risk software releases. Covering canary releases, feature switching, approaches to minimising the need for rollbacks. Nothing new for those at the cutting edge, but a good place to start or to convince sceptical management.

CFT looks very interesting. The idea is pretty simple; a command line app which remembers the resulting actions of commands you type and allows you to export them as Puppet manifests. Potentially a nice easy way of learning Puppet syntax or generating simple manifests quickly.

Who hasn't wanted a full size set of traffic lights wired up to their continuous integration server? Well here's a nice project (including circuit diagrams, Arduino details and a small Ruby script that does just that. Where you get hold of the traffic lights I'm not sure.

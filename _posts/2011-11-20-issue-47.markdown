## Issue 47 - 20th November

_Hopefully a good mix of content this week; new tools, existing tools, culture change, new services and some excellent presentations. Oh and a very exciting job for someone. Let me know what you'd like to see more (or less) of._

## News

As both a big fan of Jenkins and a frequent Ruby developer I'm pretty excited about the newly released ability to write Jenkins plugins in Ruby. Although only some parts of the API are natively available using JRuby means you can just delve into the Java if you need to.

This post suggests past some things developers and operations can agree on is a large gap which needs more discussion, namely standardisation. Mature automation probably means limiting what's being automated, and getting the conversation going about what is in a corporate wide supported platform should be done sooner rather than later.

The Percona Live MySQL conference held in London earlier in the year have released all the slides to the two days of talks. Lots of interesting looking material if you're using or interested in MySQL.

A nice article on another area of misaligned incentives, cutting operations teams because everything is running smoothly. I liked the statement "there is no easy way to prove your worth when itâ€™s only apparent when things go wrong" and the fact the article points out this isn't something you can easily fight against.

I mentioned Pennyworth last week in the tools section, it's a Jenkins based continuous deployment system which makes extensive use of Chef under the hood. This blog post acts as a quick start tutorial and should make getting started easier.

It's only in beta at the moment but Boundary looks to be another thing that can be purchased as a service, this time it's Network monitoring. Chef and Puppet code and support for Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows7, and MacOS X out of the gate too.

An excellent looking presentation on building usable command line interfaces. The later examples provide lots of good tips for people writing in Ruby, but much of the rest is relevant to everyone. Well worth a look.

Real world stories of failure are always informative and useful, and this article with examples of monitoring lying to you are fantastic. It's a good list that anyone can go back and look at their monitoring with.

## Jobs

Stripe is building next-generation infrastructure for online payments, and we're expanding our devops team. If you love building highly scalable, chaos monkey-proof systems; if automating tasks is muscle memory; and if taking updates is a cathartic experience, then you should do-release-upgrade to Stripe. To apply, send an email to jobs@stripe.com with your Github and Twitter usernames and a rant about an infrastructure tool of your choice.


## Tools

Pulse is the log stream parsing engine used by Heroku for real time monitoring of their platform. I'd be interested to see how this fits into anyone else's architecture as it looks very interesting.

I spend an awful lot of time using a terminal, but until now one thing I've generally used other tools for is quick visualisations. Enter Spark, a command line spark lines script. The quick examples, showing git commit patterns and data from a url using common command line tools are great.

Salt looks like an interesting new entry to the remote execution game. It's Python based and using 0MQ under the hood. Lots of documentation and lots of supported platforms.

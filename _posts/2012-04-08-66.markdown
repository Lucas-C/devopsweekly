## Issue 66 - 8th April

A slightly larger issue this week which should hopefully keep people going through the long weekend. And for anyone thinking about a change of jobs there is and a cheeky opportunity to come and work with me at the Government Digital Service :)

Brightbox Cloud - the UK's only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.

Interesting details of how the operations team at Spotify adopted a Kanban approach to managing there work. Nice to see information about the tools used as well as how they went about adopting and deciding upon the approach.

A nice write-up of combining an existing syslog infrastructure with Graphite to gets logs of everything. The argument made is that if you're already using syslog elsewhere you should need very few new moving parts to start gathering data.

More and more people are starting to post about their current monitoring setups. Not only does this make for good looking blog posts (graphs!) but most of them contain interesting tips and tricks that are worth experimenting with.

Infrastructure testing is still relatively new to most people and this introductory talk by Jon Topper at the recent CukeUp event might be a useful starting point. It demonstrates a number of tools including cucumber-nagios and talks about some of the current problems.

A good lighting fast slide deck on two main points of interest in operations; metrics collection and monitoring. Quick examples of good and bad log examples, approaches to common problems and things you can do to make running software easier.

Short interview with Patrick Debois about the State of Devops. The questions vary from where the movement came from to what is currently of interest at the moment. Interesting, but brief, discussion of a monitoring abstraction interface.

Good lengthy article going inside how Facebook release software to production. It includes both technical and process details and is worth a read. Although it contains technical details it's also friendly enough to share with more business minded colleagues. And it's nice to see the people behind the technology too.

Devopsdays Austin was last week and this post gave me a feeling of being there without describing the individual talks (which should be available online at some point). Lots of nice take aways from removing the hero and the villain, the move towards automation and rapid release and the interesting but so simple idea of unit tests for production security assertions.

Instagram launched a new service last week and blogged about some of the tools and techniques they used on launch day. The takeaways are good, including good real time monitoring, the ability to identify where in the stack a bottleneck is occurring and doing the capacity planning and provisioning extra read capacity ahead of time.

Events
=====

Cloud East is a new conference focused on all things Cloud. It's being held on the 28th of June in Cambridge, UK, which happens to be where I live. I'd love to meet up with any readers who are planning on heading along. They are also on the lookout for speakers for a variety of different sessions including tutorials, workshops and panels.

Jobs
====

Shameless self promotion this week I'm afraid. I'm currently hiring for sysadmin, web operations and #devops minded folks to work with me at the UK Government Digital Service. The roles are brand new and will involve everything from deployment tooling, automation and configuration management to lots of pairing with developers, security assurance and managing production systems. Any questions let me know.

Tools
====

Storm is a distributed realtime computation system, which may be of interest to a few folks. Also particularly interesting is the related deployment system. It's built on top of Pallet, the clojure automation tool and provides a nice example repo to wander through.

Wham looks like an interesting prototype. A very cryptic home page where you need to know what it's for, if you enter a public GitHub repository name containing puppet modules and manifests you get a dependency graph. Try emtrane/puppet-repo for instance. Nice idea.

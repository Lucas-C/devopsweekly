## Issue 78 - 1st July

Lots of conferences at the moment it seems, so lots of videos, slide decks and follow-up blog posts it seems. Devopsdays was the big event this last week, along with velocity. Anyone who made it along and has some good links do let me know.

Devopsdays might have just finished days ago but that hasn't stopped someone getting the videos from all the sessions up online already. They need a bit of editing and some titles would help but if you really can't wait to jump in then take a look.

One of the stand-out sessions at Devopsdays this last week was about the importance of culture to the devops movement. I've spotted a couple of good blog posts on the subject coming out of that session.

This last week I had the good luck to be one of the speakers at the first CloudEast conference in my home town of Cambridge. I did an introduction to infrastructure as code which might not be new to readers of this newsletter but certainly got a few people from different backgrounds interested in the subject.

I've not included a Vagrant post for a while so here's a lovely looking slide deck from the author of Vagrant about the benefits of a virtual machine based development workflow. Lots of good straightforward arguments to use when convincing others too.

Amazon EC2 had a large region outage this week and lots more people had problems. This post covers some of the problems and what you can do to mitigate problems from other such large supplier outages.

It's quite Splunk focused but this presentation makes a good argument that log files can be a better source for analytics than a traditional business warehouse approach. Contains some good and bad examples of log messages and a few other practical tips useful in any application.

A good article about more closely integration security detection and testing with the development cycle. Some good advice about logging, investigating out of ordinary load patterns and more.

Tools

I came across Brooklyn at CLoudEast during one of the talks. It's a Java based application deployment tool with a fancy looking web interface. You describe in code everything from what you want installed to how it should scale up and down if various monitoring checks show a need.

Credmgr is a new tool aimed at securely managing privileged account credentials via shamir secret sharing. A common use case might be when you really do need a root password but don't want to store those insecurely.

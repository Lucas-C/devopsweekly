<h2>Archive</h2>

<p><em>Many people have asked if I can archive past issues online. I'd like to eventually do something more interesting with categorising links but for the moment here's the previous issues.</em></p>

<ul id="archive">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

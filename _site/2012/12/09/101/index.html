    <h2>Issue 101 - 9th December</h2>

<p>Something about December appears to be getting lots people writing interesting blog posts. As well as Sysadvent we also have AWSAdvent and lots of blog posts, tutorials and even a few screencasts and teaching videos.</p>

<h1>Sponsor</h1>

<p>Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud - launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&hellip;</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>Another excellent advent calendar blog, this time focused on Amazon Web Services. We&rsquo;re already 9 posts in but the following two in particular stood out, being the best description and documentation I&rsquo;ve seen on both Cloudformation and the Virtual Private Cloud service.</p>

<p><a href="http://awsadvent.tumblr.com/post/37167975262/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-amazon-virtual">http://awsadvent.tumblr.com/post/37167975262/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-amazon-virtual</a>

<p>Zookeeper is one of those bits of software that lots of large organisations use but that can appear pretty impenetrable and heavyweight to everyone else. This article from the sysadvent calendar covers using Zookeeper for distributed coordination of a cluster of machines. Good high level description of Zookeeper and a nice relevant use case.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the second year of the Devops survey from Puppetlabs. A scattering of questions about what devops is and about what tools and practices people have been using this last year. The more people fill it in the better the overall results should be so if you have a spare few minutes.</p>

<p>Good content on scaling web applications can be hard to find, and harder to digest. This screencast, by Eric Lindvall of Papertrail, might be a good starting point for some. It&rsquo;s $12 but aims to cover everything from system design, metrics, software selection and business implications.</p>

<p>Nice presentation deck about the architectural choices at Etsy. Covers the software stack, metrics, rapid deployment and some of the challenges and ways of working around potential limitations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not included a what is devops post for a while but this post caught my eye. The main point it makes, with some good examples, is that devops really is about end to end business activities, not just developers and systems administrators working closer together.</p>

<p>Anemometer is an application from Box to help with optimizing mysql queries. It provides a very nice looking dashboard which provides tracking of query performance over time. This blog post covers a few tips as well as some general query profiling suggestions.</p>

<p>Good lucking introduction to Chef, including both code samples, basic instructions and videos. Looks a place to find out about Chef if you&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>

<p>Insightful post mortem writeup from GitHub about networking issues that caused some downtime a week or so ago. A good example of a detailed writeup too, with the background, what happened and future planned improvements.</p>

<h1>Jobs</h1>

<p>7digital Ltd. is a leading digital media delivery company based in Shoreditch, London and operating globally. We’re small, fast, innovative and bursting at the seams with people passionate about music and technology. Half the organisation is made up of tech people (Devs, DBA, Systems etc) and our CEO is a geek. We’ve got good at delivering our products and services at a fast pace in an iterative manner, but the faster we move the more apparent it is we need to be able to change our infrastructure just as quickly and reliably.

<p>If you&rsquo;re heading to FOSDEM at the start of February and want to arrive a few days early you might be interested in a Puppetcamp event in Ghent on the Thursday and Friday. No schedule yet.</p>

<p>Roundtrip is an interesting looking monitoring tool aimed at tracking business events. It provides a very simple HTTP API at present with more interfaces on the way. The examples shown help with working out how you might make use of it.</p>

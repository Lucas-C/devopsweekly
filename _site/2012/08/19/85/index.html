    <h2>Issue 85 - 19th August</h2>

<p>A relatively quiet issue this week, probably because I&rsquo;m back at work and suitably busy. Hopefully a little something for everyone; interviews, reading lists, approaches to testing, recruitment and monitoring to name a few. Devops, at least as I see it, really is a broad topic.</p>

<p>The initial set of talks have been announced for devopsdays Rome in October and all of them sound amazing. Early bird tickets still available too.</p>

<p>The question about whether devops is applicable to large, traditional enterprises is interesting and this pretty in-depth question and answer session with lots of smart folks makes for worthwhile reading - especially if you have an interest in large company adoption.</p>

<p>With more and more components and larger systems, an understanding of some of the theory of distributed systems is becoming increasingly useful. This is a useful, if a little dated, reading list that should provide a great start to delving into the topic from both an academic and practical standpoint.</p>

<p>A series of vagrant setups for experimenting with various monitoring tools has also led to a growing rpm package repository of some useful tools including graphite, ganglia and logstash. A good way to get started quickly if you&rsquo;re investigating new tools.</p>

<p>Hiring or at least recruitment is a popular topic in devops circles due I think to a growing demand or at least interest. This post isn&rsquo;t specific to devops but is detailed and interesting, covering lots of reasons for leaving, joining or retaining good technical staff.</p>

<p>A few year ago testing configuration management code was pretty much just an interesting conversation but now we&rsquo;ve got lots of tools to make it a reality. This blog post covers a range of tools useful for testing Chef code, as well as a few helpful utilities and tips for the resulting workflow.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Knowing how a given application is using memory, IO and CPU can be useful when debugging problems. Monner tries to make that capability even earlier to access, including during development, be providing a useful command line wrapper that outputs utilisation information.</p>

<p>If you produce relatively complex software that you want to work across a wide variety of different environments then virtual machines are an obvious solution. With vagrant and veewee as the underlying tools, bento is a modular set of basebox definitions used by Opscode. Useful as a starting point if you have similar cross-platform challenges.</p>

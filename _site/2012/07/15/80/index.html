    <h2>Issue 80 &ndash; 15th July</h2>

<p>Probably because I had three days holiday this week I appear to have found even more content than usual. Or everyone else has taken some holiday and is using the time to write up thoughts, blog posts and release some code.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>Jordan Sissel, of fpm and logstash fame, wants someone to hire him to work full time on logstash. If you&rsquo;d benefit from a kick-ass logging infrastructure, have billions of events per day and are interested in an awesome engineer then what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>Lots of web operations folk are going back to academic papers or interesting areas of research and finding useful content. This post has lots of details about the field of resilience engineering that are worth a read.</p>

<p>Interesting post on scaling lessons from the building of Dropbox. The idea of artificially increasing the load on your application early on is particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Netflix have talked in lots of detail about their approach to scaling out in EC2 but this slide deck still has a few very interesting bits. In particular it has several screen shots of internal Netflx monitoring, deployment and management tools which I always like seeing.</p>

<p>Lovely introduction to log collection with logstash. Demonstrates taking haproxy logs, creating an input and then sending the events to graphite, twitter, pagerduty, circonus and more.</p>

<p>A good takeaway from Devopsdays last week, that simplicity is key to gaining more widespread adoption of the devops movement, tools and ideas. I do read entire technical books, and cookery books, but then I guess I&rsquo;m an early adopter type.</p>

<p><a href="http://asheepapart.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/keep-it-simple-stupid.html">http://asheepapart.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/keep-it-simple-stupid.html</a></p>

<p>Another follow up post to Devopsdays, this one talking about the strong, and often ignored. focus on culture within the devops community. Some good points about tools being a required part of a cultural change and that not everyone is involved for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Deploying multiple times a day in a regulated environment can be tricky, this take covers how Etsy deal with the challenges in a PCI environment. The line &ldquo;Make sure that the team is on board and realizes that yes, thereâ€™s going to be some constraints&rdquo; struck a chord.</p>

<p>Another indication of the spread of devops ideas, these posts from Martin Fowler describing familiar concepts with details; the server configuration as unique snow flake and the phoenix server being rebuilt easily from scratch time and again.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Berkshelf is another take on a dependency management tool for Chef recipes, inspired by Bundler in ruby. Excellent documentation should make getting started easy.</p>

<p>Having all your monitoring tools able to talk to each other helps with both trying out new tools and with not being locked in as things change. Here&rsquo;s a good example, a plugin for Nagios to export metrics to the Server Density software as a service platform.</p>

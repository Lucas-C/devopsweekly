    <h2>Issue 75 &ndash; 10th June</h2>

<p>A year on from the first call of #monitoringsucks, this week we have both a good writeup of what&rsquo;s happened since, and some great videos from the SF Metrics meetup. The fact we now have well attended dedicated meetups (with really interesting talks) all about metrics and monitoring is great news for everyone interested in those topics.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>Librato and Atlassian hosted the 2nd San Francisco Metrics meetup, and the videos from two of the talks have gone up. The talks cover how Heroku make operational metrics visible and a talk from Atlassian on using Hadoop to analyse conversion funnels.</p>

<h1>monitoringsucks is a year old this week, and this post is a great summary of where it came from and more interestingly what&rsquo;s happened over the last year. Some good lists of tools and some quick discussion of some trends. Good job everyone who built something or teased out the details.</h1>

<p>Nice presentation entitled &ldquo;Devops is a verb&rdquo;. Lots of diagrams explaining where devops fits in and a start at breaking the topic down into processes, practices and importantly discussing some boundaries.</p>

<p>One feature Varnish has been missing that sometimes puts people off is the lack of a good persistence mechanism. Well, according to this post, it looks like it might be on the way. The post has a few details about the implementation and the branch is already available to use for anyone interested in trying it out.</p>

<p>Interesting article with six phases of Chef cookbook reuse. Showing the evolution from a very procedural cookbook style all the way to policy driven separate recipes.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a please for any systems administrators to learn at least three programming languages. It&rsquo;s a very quick argument but has a few points and some suggestions of how to decide which three languages might suit the job.</p>

<p>Cloudflare, the CDN and web site optimisation folks, had a nasty security incident last week. But hats off to them for writing the details up for everyone else to learn from. The visualisation of the timeline is particularly interesting.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>The Vagrant autoloading plugin mechanism turned out to be quite slow so in the upcoming 1.1 release you have to specify in your configuration which plugins to load. To make that a little easier the vagrant-plugins plugin lets you list available plugins, including details about what they do.</p>

<p>Another devopsweekly, another addition to the Graphite ecosystem. Umpire from Heroku is an HTTP interface designed to allow you to build up alerting systems. You formulate URLs which check the state of a given metric and the service returns the relevant HTTP status codes if the check passes or fails. Useful for integration with something like Pingdom or a simple HTTP check in Nagios for instance.</p>

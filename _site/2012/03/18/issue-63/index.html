    <h2>Issue 63 - 18th March</h2>

<p>Getting to see lots of content around devops makes for a great excuse to try and spot patterns. Lots of previous articles and several this issue  are encouraging, lots of smart people seeking inspiration from other more mature fields. Definitely lots still to learn.</p>

<h1>Sponsor</h1>

<p>Brightbox Cloud - the UK&rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>Interesting article about some of the changes around moving to a public cloud. Good points that, for certain software stacks at least, the unlimited capacity available can be used to work around all sorts of problems but at a financial cost. The idea of a cost aware SLA is interesting.</p>

<p>Etsy have talked before about their desire to have new starters commit code to production on day one. This new post covers the internal infrastructure they have in place to let that happen safely. Interesting that they use a central virtualisation setup using KVM.</p>

<p>Brice Figureau continues his one-man effort to document the inner workings of puppet. This post in the series is about the compiler and how it transforms the details of the node and the code you write into a catalog to be applied.</p>

<p>The NoOps debate still rages but I&rsquo;ve seen very few positive posts worth including. This one however makes a few good points on the topic. For a taster the post and comments include lines like &ldquo;I don’t feel like it’s helping us define where we want to go&rdquo; and &ldquo;either you&rsquo;re missing part of my point, or else we&rsquo;re in violent agreement&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Great slide desk on the similarities between devops and the workings of a Formula 1 racing team. Lots of good examples and points about things to learn.</p>

<p>Typesafe have released a console for there integrated scala, play and akka framework and it does look rather nice. The accompanying blog post covers some of the rationale any how certain features can be used to isolate production problems. The online is nice to explore too. I&rsquo;d love to see an open source framework for building interactive dashboards like this.</p>

<p>One of the presentations that caught my eye from the recent Qcon was this one on ensuring resilient responses in complex systems. Lots of notes from academic literature and interesting looking books plus loads of real world examples and things you can do to make your applications more resilient.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Nervous aims to provide the building blocks for building your own monitoring systems. It&rsquo;s a node.js framework based around a simple plugin architecture and provides a simple way for sending data to Graphite too.</p>

<p>Rails default logging can be useful while developing applications but it&rsquo;s pretty annoying when it comes to production applications. Lograge is an attempt to fix that, extracted from the Travis CI codebase. It takes the multiline logging and changes everything to one line per request.</p>

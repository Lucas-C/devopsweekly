<h1>News</h1>

<p>The Olympics is nearly over, and the BBC have published a thoroughly interesting article and sets of architecture diagrams about how they dealt with the rather large software requirements. Everything from meta data, video streaming, caching and more. The big diagram alone with worth spending some time looking over.</p>

<p>Nice post from the GitHub folks on how they monitor the performance of the application. Lots and lots of custom dashboards that should act as inspiration for anyone doing the same.</p>

<p>A good article introducing configuration management to developers published in the IEEE Software. Good points about the growing complexity of software requiring more involvement in infrastructure from developers.</p>

<p>Hardware is often ignored in all the software talk, especially as lots of traditional hardware activities are increasingly being abstracted in software. But their is still a place for hardware talk and both 37 Signals and Etsy have published interesting articles in the week or so.</p>

<p>Everyone has logs but how often people use them probably varies hugely. This article covers some of the uses you might put your logs and different techniques for getting value out of them.</p>

<p>Fancy looking event tracking and graphing tool built on eventmachine and redis. Lots of sample configurations provided that should make getting started easier.</p>

<p>Astor is an interesting looking alternative to Graphite and Statsd. It provides a simple HTTP based API, a ZeroMQ interface and installation instructions for getting setup on EC2 quickly.</p>

    <h2>Issue 92 - 7th October</h2>

<p>A slide deck heavy issue this week with lots of Velocity and DevopsDays content, with I&rsquo;m sure much more to find over the next few weeks if I get the chance. I&rsquo;ve also just realised the content this week has a bit of a UK theme, with talks and events from London and tools and posts from Brits on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<h1>A Note from your Curator</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to be visiting San Francisco in November to speak at the excellent QCon conference. I&rsquo;ll be around all week from the 5th so if anyone has any recommendations for things to do or wants to meet up let me know. If you&rsquo;re interested in the conference you can register with the code &ldquo;rush100&rdquo; and get an extra $100 off the price too :)</p>

<h1>Velocity</h1>

<p>I spent a few days this week at the excellent Velocity conference in London. Lots of great talks, demos and discussions. Here&rsquo;s a few of the posts and slide decks I&rsquo;ve come across so far.</p>

<p>The conference website has already published some slides and videos from the conference, mainly of the keynote sessions from the morning slots. The talks from Chris Brown (Opscode) and Girish Patangay (Facebook) in particular are worth watching.</p>

<p>Slides from one of the tutorials entitled Escalating Scenarios: Outage Handling Pitfalls. It makes the case that you are definitely going to have failures in production and provides lots of tips for how to deal with them when  (and before) they occur.</p>

<p>Another one of the tutorials, this time focusing on the importance of monitoring to complex application architectures. It stresses the importance of being able to observe the system at work, without which you won&rsquo;t have the ability to react to failures quickly.</p>

<p>Great talk from the folk at Etsy about the progression from 2007 to now in terms of size and culture. It goes year by year through the evolution of the organisation, showing just how much effort went in to create the right environment for all the tools that came later.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>The discussions of how much automation is sensible kicked off a few good posts, this one reveals some nifty Puppet patterns for making configuration variables immutable, for cases when changing them is much better done by hand.</p>

<p>Caching is an interesting topic, and important to have a clear plan in place if you want to use it without lots of puzzling debugging sessions. This blog post proposes some interesting approaches to application architecture for web apps.</p>

<p>Facebook have talked before about how they run the operations side of the site, and this article has a few interesting bits and pieces about the details. Lots of familiar topics from metrics to a culture of shared ownership and the need for everyone to be involved in operating the software applications they build.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still gutted I couldn&rsquo;t make DevopsDays this week, if only because I missed this talk. It&rsquo;s a great overview of the current state of open source monitoring. It kicks off with a dive into terminology, touches on lots of interesting topics (metrics as first class business data), lists the good and bad of open source tools and tries to paint a picture of a composable future.</p>

<h1>Events</h1>

<p>An event all about continuous integrations and deployment pipelines in London later this month. It&rsquo;s free to register and being held on the 25th of October in the Mozilla offices near Covent Garden from 6:30pm.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Building frameworks around conventions is something of a specialty for 37 Signals. They have just released the tools they use to make the 37 command line tool chain and it provides a nice way of grouping ad-hoc scripts with the bonus of autocompletion.</p>

<p>FITB automatically polls every port on a list of switches you give it and generates handy RRD graphs. Great for very quickly getting at network IO and discovering what all your ports are doing.</p>

<p>Pencil is another tool for building dashboards from data in Graphite. Once pointed at your Graphite install you can configure dashboards and graphs in YAML. It would be nice to see a screen shot in the readme but it might be worth checking out.</p>

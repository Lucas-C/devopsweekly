    <h2>Issue 73 - 27th May</h2>

<p>Lots of &ldquo;people&rdquo; content this week, including talk of relationships with other business groups, lists of practices worth implementing, user centred organisations and a laptop made specifically for people like us. Still room for some good technical content too, Buster.JS looks great for anyone doing some high level web testing.</p>

<h1>Sponsor</h1>

<p>Brightbox Cloud - the UK&rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>Another good post about he relationship between development, operations and a security function. Some good follow up comments as well, I&rsquo;d love to see some more case studies around this topic.</p>

<p><a href="http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-White-Rabbit/What-s-in-a-name-Does-DevOps-need-a-security-flavor/ba-p/5663931">http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-White-Rabbit/What-s-in-a-name-Does-DevOps-need-a-security-flavor/ba-p/5663931</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a nice list of ideal operations practices as a Gist (already with a couple of forks). Definitely worth reading through and comparing to what you&rsquo;re doing at present - I&rsquo;d guess for most environments it would help focus on a few areas worth spending time on.</p>

<p>Interesting collaboration between Canonical and Dell to try and make a high quality developer centric laptop. The GitHub powered templates sound interesting, as do some of the other features. Hopefully the 6 month project will bear fruit - I&rsquo;d love to try something like this when they fix the trackpad issues.</p>

<p>The answer isn&rsquo;t always to automate everything it seems. This post discusses some pros and cons of automating a documentation workflow but the argument stands for most processes.</p>

<p>A good write-up of some of the discussions from GOTO about driving development work from metrics. Mentions why factoring metrics collection into your definition of done is a good idea and has a good example of a simple feature that actually generates lots of useful metrics if we choose the collect them.</p>

<p>One of the presentations that inspired the above blog post, Using monitoring and metrics to learn in development. Some good monitoring sucks material and a few great diagrams of where process improvements could be made.</p>

<p>I work in a very user-centred environment at the moment so this blog post made interesting reading. That we&rsquo;re seeing lots of barriers broken down isn&rsquo;t new, but the lists of why different groups care about items that may have been separate from their silo previous is good.</p>

<h1>Events</h1>

<p>The first CloudCamp North event is talking place on the 14th of June in Leeds, UK. It&rsquo;s an evening affair with lots of lightning talks and a chance to talk to smart interesting folk from the likes of Brightbox (who sponsor this newsletter), Basho (of Riak fame) and HP.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Mentioned in one of the presentation from ChefConf, Spork is a Knife workflow plugin designed to help teams work with a set of cookbooks and Chef environments.</p>

<p>High level integration testing in browsers can often be somewhat painful, so Buster.JS looks interesting. It&rsquo;s a JavaScript test framework for node and browsers; it supports running tests in local browsers, headless tests, proxying to live websites, and comes with good support for mocks and stubs and other modern testing techniques.</p>

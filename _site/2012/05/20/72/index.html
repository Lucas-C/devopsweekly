    <h2>Issue 72 &ndash; 20th May</h2>

<p>I hope you have nothing planned for this next week as this issue is rather packed with content, especially if you&rsquo;re a Chef fan. ChefConf last week sounded like it went very well indeed, and we have lots of links to slide decks, videos and new tools included.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>Working for the UK Government I&rsquo;m increasingly involved with security related concerns, so this article is pretty timely. It looks at what can be done a part of a continuous delivery pipeline when it comes to security, with mention of continuous integration, static analysis and the part played by configuration management.</p>

<p>PuppetDB is finally out in the wild. On one hand it&rsquo;s a clojure based replacement for the store configuration database, on the other it&rsquo;s the start of a nice query interface to all the information Puppet collects as it goes about it&rsquo;s configuration management business. Currently labelled a beta but well worth checking out.</p>

<p>I mentioned a Gem last week we&rsquo;ve been using at work for a simple continuous deployment workflow for Gems. This detailed writeup covers another approach to the same problem, using more detailed Jenkins steps and going into the whole workflow.</p>

<p>Sharing code tends to be much easier if everyone uses a similar style. This work in progress style guide for Chef cookbooks looks interesting, and</p>

<p>OpenShift is the new platform as a service from RedHat, offering support for Java, Ruby, Python, Node.js, PHP and Perl. It&rsquo;s currently free to use, and the documentation looks good for getting started.</p>

<p>A great 50 month retrospective of an agile transformation, taking in automation, continuous delivery and automated testing. The comparisons of different stages of growth, the detailed numbers and the great illustrations make this a great read for anyone working in a rapidly expanding team.</p>

<p>Patrick has started documenting practices, patterns and principles indicative of successful devops projects and is looking for any and all feedback. The ultimata aim appears to be a maturity based model, but even at this stage it could make discussion around specific practices much easier.</p>

<p>Another great presentation from inside Etsy about managing a devops flavoured operations team in a rapidly growing company. Lots of tips on people, processes, hiring and management in general. Some good insider details too about using Kanban successfully and using metrics (Etsy now have more than 280,000 individual metrics!) to make decisions.</p>

<p>Logging is important, but it&rsquo;s also a big topic. Especially for those coming from a more development background the number of different types and locations of log files can be daunting. So this introductory post is good to see. It has lots of details about application logs, syslog and what to look out for in a typical web server context.</p>

<h1>ChefConf</h1>

<p>Nice general write-up of the first ChefConf event. Brief discussion of the workshops, pre-conference hack day and some of the stand-out talks. Sounds like it was a great event.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ducea.com/2012/05/18/chefconf-2012-san-francisco/">http://www.ducea.com/2012/05/18/chefconf-2012-san-francisco/</a></p>

<p>One of the stand-out talks from the conference from what I&rsquo;ve heard, Avoiding Kitchen Nightmares contains lots of tooling and workflow tips and tricks for Chef users. Testing, linting and release workflows are all discussed in some detail.</p>

<p>The regularly featured Food Fight podcast went into overdrive at ChefConf, producing 7 short updates and an R Rated final recap. That should keep you busy till next year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012_05_01_archive.html">http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012_05_01_archive.html</a></p>

<p>And if that&rsquo;s not enough and you&rsquo;re looking for even more links, slides and videos this week then the Food Fight folk are collecting all the links to #ChefConf material on GitHub. A good number of the videos are already up on YouTube.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Nimrod is a metrics server purely based on log processing. Your application outputs logs according to a simple format and Nimrod consumes these and presents metrics (gauges, counters, timers, etc.) information over an HTTP interface for other applications to consume.</p>

<p>StarCluster from MIT is a Python tool for summoning and controlling a cluster of EC2 machines aimed at scientific computation. It includes tools for map/reduce, parallel processing, linear algebra and scientific algorithms amongst others.</p>

<p>Sous Chef is a nifty looking tool from the Travis CI folks for testing Chef cookbooks with a local vagrant powered virtual machine. It&rsquo;s predominantly a well documented workflow and a sample Vagrantfile, but worth a look for a few good tips.</p>

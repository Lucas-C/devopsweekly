    <h2>Issue 57 - 5th February</h2>

<p>This weeks issue comes direct from FOSDEM. I&rsquo;m currently chatting about monitoring and related perils with Patrick Debois, Mitchell Hashimoto and a bunch of other equally smart folks. The configuration management room has been interesting so far, and the cloud devroom yesterday had some interesting talks too. FOSDEM is definitely the place to be this weekend it seems.</p>

<h1>Sponsor</h1>

<p>Brightbox Cloud - the UK&rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>Systems administration is changing, and this post makes quite a strong argument that for many if not most sysadmins the future is about automation, configuration management and disposable virtual machines.</p>

<p>Something else I saw in a talk at FOSDEM this weekend, this online app lets you calculate or play around with the measure of availability for your system based on the mean time between failure and mean time to recovery values. A nice way of highlighting the importance of what needs to happen to improve availability.</p>

<p>A rather ominously titled post, but one that&rsquo;s not as negative as it appears. I particularly like the focus on how the same words are often used to describe different things by different groups &ldquo;would ops define an “application” in Puppet the same way dev would define an “application” in Hudson&rdquo;? Without sharing terminology modelling dependencies across tools becomes much harder.</p>

<p>Zynga has a number of unusual requirements when it comes to managing it&rsquo;s game servers. This post, although light on technical details, talks a little about how they are using ZooKeeper to make configuration changes across the entire fleet in under a second.</p>

<p>Using continuous integration systems to do more than just run a test suite against your code is becoming more and more common, this example takes a web.config configuration file for a .NET project and runs a large number of security checks against it. This approach has a number of advantages, in particular meaning once you&rsquo;ve fixed the highlighted issues they stay fixed.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s maybe too easy to think about Devops just in terms of devs and ops, and ignore all the other folks who are part of a well rounded product team. One group that often gets overlooked are the support folks, if any set of people can help bridge the communications gaps it&rsquo;s good professional communicators. This post, from a former developer at Flickr, really gets that across - in the form of a rant about why firing much of the support team is such a mistake.</p>

<p>Sensu, the nice looking new monitoring framework, is picking up speed it seems. Describing Sensu as a &ldquo;monitoring router&rdquo; makes for a nice picture, this post covers integrating Sensu with Graphite.</p>

<p>The topic of NoOps cropped up again this week, and this post neatly summed up some of what I think, in particular it&rsquo;s &ldquo;always Operations somewhere&rdquo;. Operations is about running something and knowing how it works far more than it&rsquo;s about specific tools and technology.</p>

<p><a href="http://paulgraydon.co.uk/blog/2012/02/03/the-fallacy-of-noops/">http://paulgraydon.co.uk/blog/2012/02/03/the-fallacy-of-noops/</a></p>

<p>And another follow up to the post about NoOps. This one really gets down to the problem with words and terminology. I think people really do want basically the same future, but trying to get into the debate with terms that actively exclude people is just poor marketing.</p>

<h1>Events</h1>

<p>The first devopsdays event is approaching, this one is being held in Austin, Texas on the 2nd and 3rd of April. They are still looking for sponsors and speakers so if you&rsquo;re interested get in touch via the site.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Deltacloud appears to have been around for a while as it&rsquo;s a full Apache project, but I only came across it yesterday in one of the talks at FOSDEM. It&rsquo;s a Ruby web service that exposes a standard API for interacting with different cloud infrastructure providers like EC2, OpenStack and Rackspace. It&rsquo;s a simple HTTP interface so you could just grab servers using curl, but the project also has a number of native client libraries.</p>

<p>Another new monitoring tool gathering some interest this week is Extremon. It appears early days (the code is just being made public on GitHub) but the aims and examples sound interesting. If anyone is at the #monitoringsucks hack day this week and gets a demo I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>

<p>Pas a certain number of projects the Jenkins dashboard can look quite busy. Jenkins features simple custom views but even this might not be enough on larger projects. Enter the View Job Filters plugins which provides a dizzying number of customisable options, some based both on the logged in user and the current state of various builds.</p>

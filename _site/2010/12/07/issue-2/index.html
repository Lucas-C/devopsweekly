    <h2>Issue 2 &#8211; 7th December 2010</h2>
<p>Thanks for all the feedback since last week. I had a few issues with links being rewritten to be rather on the long side when the final newsletter was sent out. I was hoping to have time this week to get round to resolving but alas the week flew by. The same will happen again this time but I&#8217;ve positioned the links after the text so it should be easier to read. I&#8217;ll probably move to a very simple <span class="caps">HTML</span> format as time permits.</p>
<h2>News</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s December which means we have lots of blogs trying to publish a new article every day. One such blog that I found last year and is keeping up the high standard again is <span class="caps">SYSADVENT</span>. The pick of the articles for me so far has been this one, talking about using code reviews in operations teams.</p>

<p>People interested in <span class="caps">PERFORMANCE</span> even have their own advent calendar blog, again publishing some really good content already. This article about the need for generalists within software teams I think runs parallel with many of the ideas of devops, at least as I see them.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago now a group of about 35 London based developers and ops people met up to talk about <span class="caps">DEPLOYMENT</span>. The nice folks at YouDevise let us use a room in their offices and we had at it for a good few hours. The videos taken during the event have just been published and make an educational and occasionally entertaining watch.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a new article but I found it interesting coming from <span class="caps">GARTNER</span>. If you&#8217;re working in a large enterprise it can often be tricky to get buy-in for new ideas or ways of working. Having large companies outside the technology sector as well as analyst firms advocating for some of the things we&#8217;re all talking about can only be beneficial.</p>

<p>Matthew Jones has put together a pretty comprehensive <span class="caps">SURVEY</span> around devops. We&#8217;ve seen lots of people writing about what they think devops means, so it should be interested if enough people fill this out to see what a wider group think.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">HUDSON</span> project have been having some political issues of late and it&#8217;s good to see them publishing regular updates to the wider community. Continuous Integration plays a big part in quite a few devops ideas and we need a mature open source player in the area.</p>

<p><span class="caps">MCOLLECTIVE</span> has traditionally used ApacheMQ for it&#8217;s messaging needs and several people (myself included) had enquired about whether it could work with RabbitMQ, especially for people that already had that message queue in a production environment. With recent patches to the Stomp adaptor for Rabbit, and this handy tutorial you should be up and running in no time.</p>

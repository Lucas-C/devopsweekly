    <h2>Issue 14 &#8211; 17th March 2011</h2>
<p><em>More interesting news and tools from last week. If anyone has anything they think would be of interest to folks do let me know at gareth@morethanseven.net</em></p>
<h2>News</h2>
<p>I finally managed to get a site built this week to provide a list of Vagrant base boxes. The question comes up on Twitter or blog posts or mailing lists pretty regularly. Hopefully a few people find it useful.</p>

<p>Amazon have just expanded their virtual networking for Amazon EC2, adding in lots more functionality which to my mind make it much more useful. You can now run with a single public subnet, with public and private subnets, with Internet and <span class="caps">VPN</span> access or with <span class="caps">VPN</span> access only.</p>

<p>Dean Wilson has been doing some interesting things around testing deployments and infrastructure changes using Nagios, and <span class="caps">NRPE</span> Runner looks a handy tool if you&#8217;re interested in doing the same. The basic premise is to have a command allowing you to run your nagios checks like a test suite.</p>

<p>Ted Dziuba&#8217;s latest article covers what and why to monitor, and what makes for a good system that can be easily checked. The focus of monitoring checks should be to keep them Informative and Actionable, which I like.</p>

<p>Zed Shaw always writes good opinion pieces and this one has a number of good points. The basic gist is that more programmers should actually learn how statistics really works, which I have to agree with. The more we look for evidence for application or process improvements the more important it is to get the analysis right.</p>

<p>A pretty formal article introducing some folks to the concepts behind Devops. I&#8217;m quite interested in the idea that Devops might be a sort-of bridge between IT Service management with Agile development practices</p>

<p>Branches are an important part of lots of development workflows, and with the increasing adoption of version control for configuration management file and the mantra of &#8220;infrastructure as code&#8221; some people are starting to talk about how to use branches for these too.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>The nice folks at Etsy continue releasing various useful tools, this time Logster is a very handy looking tool for parsing log files and generating metrics for Graphite and Ganglia from the results.</p>

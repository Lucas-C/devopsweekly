    <h2>Issue 12 &#8211; 1st March 2011</h2>
<p><em>A big thank you to everyone who filled out the survey last week. So far I&#8217;ve amassed over 600 responses which should make for some good analysis. Now with interesting devops new for the week.</em></p>
<h2>News</h2>
<p>The big news this week was Amazon&#8217;s launch of CloudFormation, which is a way of creating templates to describe your infrastructure, which can then be executed to provision EC2 instances and other <span class="caps">AWS</span> components automatically.</p>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/</a></p>
<p>On hearing about CloudFormation various parts of the internet exploded with comments about how they no longer needed Chef or Puppet, missing the difference between configuration management and provisioning (<span class="caps">AWS</span> specific provisioning at that) entirely. Luckily Mitchell Hashimoto (of Vagrant fame) and Stephen Nelson-Smith both came to the rescue.</p>

<p>R.I.Pienaar meanwhile was busy showing how CloudFormation can be useful (with a great mcollective example) and then breaking down some of the good and bad points about the current implementation.</p>

<p>Node.js got some nice things said about it by the smart folk at SimpleGeo. They argue that Node.js is a good candidate for production services right now and outline some of the reasons they chose it and things they like.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in Chicago this Saturday you might be interested in a Puppet Hack-a-thon being organised by Martin J. Logan. Two tracks and Puppetlabs founder Teyo Tyree should make for an interesting event.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Tav has reworked the core of Fabric to add all sorts of shiny new features and remove a few scars. An environment variable manager, remote script execution, contexts (more advanced roles and hosts control), parallel deployment, stages, a build-in shell, autocompletion and even colours for output. And some other things too. I really hope this gets merged upstream.</p>

<p>An interesting presentation, that actually works just reading the slides. Interesting alternative to package installation and bootstrapping using Fabric and an extension called Cuisine. And details of system monitoring using Watchdog.</p>

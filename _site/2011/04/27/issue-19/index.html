    <h2>Issue 19 &#8211; 27th April 2011</h2>
<p><em>I&#8217;m not sure whether it&#8217;s just because I&#8217;m on holiday and have more time on my hands or whether it&#8217;s just been a busy week but lots of news and interesting tool releases this last week.</em></p>
<h2>News</h2>
<p>As I was busy sending the last issue Amazon <span class="caps">AWS</span> was having some rather epic issues. While everyones boxes where inaccessible people used the time to write blog posts about the downtime. The High Scalability blog has about 50 articles.</p>

<p>Twilio use EC2 extensively but had very few issues, due to focusing on the principal of a &#8220;unit-of-failure is a single host&#8221;. This had meant they had avoided using <span class="caps">EBS</span> to avoid such a problem.</p>

<p>Jordan Sissel gave a talk about fpm at the recent BayLISA event. It&#8217;s a great slide desk, laying down the problems with various forays in packaging and then showing code examples of using fpm to build debs and rpms.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfMTdmczY2azlkcg&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1">https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfMTdmczY2azlkcg&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1</a></p>
<p>Nice write up by Mujtaba Hussain of mixing developers and operations staff members up a little, by loaning team members to different divisions to try and get better communication. Some good discussion in the comments too about what&#8217;s worked for other people.</p>

<p>Common patterns for software build and release sounds like a great idea, and Julian Simpson wrote an article for the Spring 2011 issue of Methods &amp; Tools on just that, based on conversations at last years <span class="caps">SPA</span> Conference in London.</p>

<p>Obligatory Vagrant article this time again with a thorough write up of the benefits and purpose of Vagrant, as well as a big Drupal example. This is probably the first time I&#8217;ve seen a shared Vagrantfile, which is a great idea come to think of it.</p>

<p>Graphite looks pretty interesting for adhoc graphing duties, but the installation and setup isn&#8217;t trivial. This article walks through all the steps and looks like it&#8217;s going to turn into a series about using Graphite. Look forward the the next one.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Virtual Machine Test Harness is an interesting take on writing tests for configuration management tools. Uses <span class="caps">KVM</span> under the hood to take snapshots at different states for testing against. Lacking documentation at the moment though.</p>

<p>The folks at Rackspace have released a preview of their open source deployment tool, Cast. It&#8217;s an <span class="caps">API</span> driven Node.js application which aims to let you automate deployment of applications and services, although it feels odd that the example given is for Redis rather than say a web application.</p>

<p>Pulp is a Python application for managing software repositories and their associated content, such as packages, errata, and distributions. Another tool in this area from RedHat.</p>

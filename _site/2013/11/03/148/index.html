<p>Debugging distributed systems is hard, and requires a few new tools in your toolbox. This presentation deck from the recent Strata conference demonstrates a few approaches and some interesting looking new tools like SysSQL.</p>

<p>Good post describing a view of devops from the point of view of a large enterprise organisation. Describes some of the similarities and some of the differences from the typical startup or technology company and focuses on things that large organisations can learn.</p>

<p>A nice, detailed, post about how Groupon rebuilt their web application from scratch to get away from a monolithic architecture originally grown by buying companies. Lots of good tips and a host of nice diagrams explaining the approach taken.</p>

<p>A good call to arms for security specialists to get involved with devops. A few myths called out as well as pitching devops as a way for security practitioners to get involved in the development process earlier.</p>

<p>I included the Knight Capital findings from the SEC last week, this post covers the same document but points out fundamental differences between it and what is required in a post-mortem focused on explaining what happened and preventing future occurences.</p>

<p>A nice post about designing your monitoring checks, focusing on context and what is important to your organisation, rather than collecting all the metrics available.</p>

<p>A good introduction to why companies can benefit from taking a devops approach, with 3 practices to get you started; shared environments that look like production, involving the entire team in on-call activities and automating application deployment.</p>

<p>An interesting open letter to the SAP community about how it can make it’s popular tools more compatible with more web-native tools. Interesting to see pressure like this on traditional enterprise software vendors.</p>

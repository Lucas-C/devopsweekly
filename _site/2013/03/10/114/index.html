    <h2>Issue 114 - 10th March</h2>

<p>Fewer tools but an awful lot to read this week, including a few short books available for free online. If you skip everything else or just skim the outlines I&rsquo;d definitely read the first article in full. Then read it again and think about how it applies to our domain of fast moving technology, and more importantly how we avoid the need for too much devops archaeology in the future.</p>

<p>Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud - launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&hellip;</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>This first article doesn&rsquo;t appear to have anything to do with devops. It&rsquo;s about institutional memory, engineering archaeology, documentation and document management. It&rsquo;s about a chemical engineering plant. But I bet most people can read this and see it either in their past or future when it comes to the computer system we build.</p>

<p>A Platform as a Service is generally made up of quite a few interesting moving parts. This free book (available online or to download) covers some of the dotcloud details, but much of the software discussed is open source. Some good low level resource management and file system stuff.</p>

<p>Nice write-up of continuous deployment from an individual developers perspective. I particularly liked the like &ldquo;The real secret to the success of continuous deployment is that code is pushed before it’s done&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Anyone running real life systems will get reports of errors from users or the code itself at some point, and not all error reports are useful (to put it politely). This post covers a manifesto for error reporting, with several good tips worth considering next time you write error handling code.</p>

<p>Chef 11 has some awesome new features, but unless you&rsquo;ve been following along closely you might have some work to do to resolve some breaking changes. Here&rsquo;s a good walk though of a few of the gotchas that should see you on Chef 11 in no time.</p>

<p>Understanding the potential security risks of browser based applications can be quite a challenge, their are quite a few odd attack vectors and things people place too much trust in (third party javascript anyone?). This excellent on-line book has a wealth of information about all things browser and security. Well worth a read. I just wish I could find a good ebook version.</p>

<p>Logging is a source of lots of interesting and useful information, but getting the right setup for you can take time. Here&rsquo;s five simple steps to make your application logging better.</p>

<p>Armatures is a new community project from Puppetlabs which aims to provide a way for people to suggest proposals to enhance or add features to Puppet or something in the Puppet ecosystem. It&rsquo;s just a GitHub repo and the first armature documents the process to follow to make proposals. Interesting idea.</p>

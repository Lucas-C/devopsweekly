<p><em>Welcome to the nearly 500 new subscribers who have signed up in the last two weeks for Devops Weekly.

Do email me with anything you find that&rsquo;s interesting.</em></p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>Good writeup from the recent devopsdays Austin, focusing on why culture is important, but just as importantly why it&rsquo;s hard to talk about and address. I particularly liked the observation that effective culture can be very different between different groups of people.</p>

<p>Slidedeck going through a series of interviews with people from the devops community. Covers topics such as where we are now, favourite ideas and tools and where devops goes next.</p>

<p>Interesting take on the Bay area bubble when it comes to the overlap of devops and cloud infrastructures. My experience in the UK at work and at devopsdays is similar, lots of software and infrastructure that runs real companies would be seen as legacy by your average startup.</p>

<p>A nice presentation (with the new Opscode branding) introducing the power of automation. It&rsquo;s a nice short case study of a real world problems being solved by automating hard or slow parts of a problematic process.</p>

<p>A great success story for Cloudfoundry solving a gnarly technical problem. What if a 50 minute outage could result in you losing half of your yearly income? Good example of playing to the strengths of Platform as a Service.</p>

<p>Where is devops heading in the future? A short entertaining take on some of the core bits of devops (culture, automation, measurement and sharing) and how they might spread.</p>

<p>The discussion of ZFS on Linux comes up occasionally and this recent blog post appears to be a great introduction to the state of the art. Lots of links to further info too.</p>

<p>A good reminder that when choosing software, starting by looking at SaaS is probably the way to go. A good discussion of the different costs in SaaS, PaaS and IaaS as well.</p>

<p>A nice reminder that there are multiple approaches to what we often refer to devops, and that so much of it is about the benefits of working with people with different skills.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.indecorous.com/ops/">http://www.indecorous.com/ops/</a></p>

<p>A look into the differences between LXC and Docker. Some good observations, but parts are based on docker defaults rather than all the possibilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flockport.com/lxc-vs-docker/">http://www.flockport.com/lxc-vs-docker/</a></p>

<p>A nice introduction to service discovery and consul in particular. Some good tips for setting up clusters and understanding the number of servers and agents for best results.</p>

<p>A detailed writeup of setting up a very modern infrastructure, using CoreOS and Kubernetes on top of OpenStack using Heat. The discussion of the network setup is particularly interesting.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Lots of interest at the moment in how to run containers across multiple hosts, and part of that is the network layer. Weave is a router that runs in a container, designed for connecting together docker containers.</p>

<p>Knowing what versions of which Puppet modules people are using is hard to track, enter Puppet Analytics. A simple client and a basic web based dashboard, I’ll be interested to see if this takes off.</p>

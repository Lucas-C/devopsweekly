<h1>News</h1>

<p>A great post on the importance of management, in particular picking up the over-emphasis on technical skills in technical environments at the expense of understanding the importance of management.</p>

<p>A good exposition of things you need in place to take advantage of a microservices style architecture. Lots of focus on operations here, including provisioning, monitoring, deployment and product centric teams.</p>

<p>Last week was Velocity New York, from which a view of the posts this week are taken from. Lots of the keynote videos are already up too, with talks on team organisation to monitoring and data storage to low level network optimisation.</p>

<p>A nice short post on application architecture, a reminder that it’s as much an organisation design problem as about software, and that different size teams might need to make different trade-offs.</p>

<p>A Gartner piece entitled Seven Steps to Start Your DevOps Initiative. Lots of good observations in here, and the key challenges picked out are interesting if you’re talking with your CIO or similar level execs.</p>

<p>Lots of people are building microservice based systems at the moment so this post, with a number of techniques that worked and a few that didn’t, should be useful for anyone getting started.</p>

<h1>Events</h1>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Taste tester is another workflow tool for Chef, it launches a Chef-Zero instance locally and then checks what changes would happen to a remote machine with your local changes.</p>

<p>A set of scripts useful for hardening a typical Linux system. Partly useful for learning about a good practices, I’d also love to see this converted into various config management code flavours.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>A nice list of 8 organisation characteristics that enable a devops way of working. Nicely illustrated with examples from a real large organisation.</p>

<p><a href="http://seroter.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/8-characteristics-of-our-devops-organization-2/">http://seroter.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/8-characteristics-of-our-devops-organization-2/</a></p>

<p>A good post looking at a study into alarm fatigue in a hospital and what can be learned and applied to alert fatigue in monitoring. A call to actions too for companies to publish studies analysing different alert management techniques.</p>

<p>Most developers or operations people will be familiar with an annoying number of similar but different package management tools. This post tries to outline the fundamental problem, and highlights a few common approaches.</p>

<p>An interesting insight into the costs of bandwidth around the world. A good overview of how the internet works at the network level too.</p>

<p>Some good points about the real benefit of microservices being in how organisations and teams work. Also a good reminder that if you’re building for the web you’re already being distributed systems whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>An interesting perspective on the different ways to reach a devops culture. I’m not sure I agree completely, for instance event attendees vary wildly from event to event or between geographies, but some good observations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.activestate.com/blog/2014/08/road-devops">http://www.activestate.com/blog/2014/08/road-devops</a></p>

<p>A new infrastructure focused podcast, Software Defined Talk. Quite an industry focus, with observations about identity and access management and VMware’s cloud moves.</p>

<h1>Jobs</h1>

<p>We thought the process of finding a new DevOps job needed to be shaken up. So we built Hired, the first true marketplace for engineers. Join a Hired one-week auction and let 1,000+ companies compete for you.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>If you’re using Test Kitchen then you might find the kitchen-sync plugin useful. It provides alternative file sync strategies which should be faster than the defaults for certain setups.</p>

<p>An interesting DNS server which connects to the AWS API and returns DNS records based on instance names or roles.</p>

<p>Scumblr is an interesting tool for keeping an eye on potential exploits or discussions of your company/application elsewhere on the internet. All sorts of potential monitoring applications for this.</p>

    <h2>Issue 177 - 25th May</h2>

<p><em>Some weeks I spot a definite topic that links many of the posts and tools together. This week’s content is all over the place; human computer interaction, enterprise adoption, complex systems, small teams starting out with automation, containers, security testing and more. I hope people enjoy the variety as much as I do.</em></p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>It’s only relatively recently I’ve seen anyone talking about actually designing the alerts we receive from our monitoring systems. This post is a nice introduction with a few good ideas too. The statement “Sometimes the alerts do little more than tell us that something went bump” is definitely true.</p>

<p>A great response to the post I included last week about the challenges of adopting devops practices in traditional enterprises. It’s still strange to see this playing out in the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>A nice presentation extolling the benefits of instrumentation combined with documentation when operating complex systems.</p>

<p>A presentation all about Google’s use of containers. So mind blowing numbers (Google starts 2 billion containers every week). Also includes reference to some new tools and upcoming features of Google Compute Engine.</p>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jbeda/containers-at-scale">https://speakerdeck.com/jbeda/containers-at-scale</a></p>

<p>A good story of moving from a small team with mainly manual deployment processes to something more automated, and the advantages that brought.</p>

<p>An interesting insight into the state of graphite backends. A good description of what an ideal backend might look light and some initial investigations using influxdb.</p>

<p>A solid definition of what microservices are; based on ownership of a simple domain, a separate data store, running in separate processes and communicating via defined interfaces.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2014/05/21/what-is-a-microservice-and-why-does-it-matter/">http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2014/05/21/what-is-a-microservice-and-why-does-it-matter/</a></p>

<p>A call to arms to ensure automated deployment pipelines do not ignore the manual process of code reviews. Some good arguments.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Container agent is a tool for launching a set of containers based on a simple manifest file. Although designed for Google Compute Engine it appears like it should work anywhere. The documentation contains lots of good examples.</p>

<p>Radial is described as being intended to help understand, record, and put into practice the intersection between Twelve-Factor App best-practices and Docker features. It’s provides a defined language as well as examples of how to compose a set of containers.</p>

<p>An OWASP project, Mantra is a browser for use when auditing the security of web applications. Under the hood it’s Firefox with a large number of very useful plugins, from traffic capture to XSS scanners.</p>

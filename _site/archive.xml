    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 142 &amp;ndash; 22nd September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just back from Berlin and the first Monitorama EU conference. First thanks to the organisers who put on a great event and second thanks to the speakers and workshop organisers for all the great content, some of which I’ve linked to below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Monitorama&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This monitorama talk discussed the use of algorithms in monitoring and anomaly detection, and points out why some of our statistical tools are all that useful given the data we collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/astanway/mom-my-algorithms-suck&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/astanway/mom-my-algorithms-suck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the good fortune to speak at Monitorama this time around, about integrating various security and penetration testing tools with a modern open source monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/security-monitoring-penetration-testing-meets-monitoring&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/security-monitoring-penetration-testing-meets-monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have lots of metrics you probably want to alert on certain states. This next presentation covered the psychology of alert design with examples from other types of alert systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/auxesis/the-psychology-of-alert-design&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/auxesis/the-psychology-of-alert-design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the general themes of the conference was using monitoring tools for much more than measuring low level system metrics. This talk discusses all sorts of business information that is useful to measure and what tools (if any) are used for that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/JeffWeinstein1/monitorama-how-monitoring-can-improve-the-rest-of-the-company&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/JeffWeinstein1/monitorama-how-monitoring-can-improve-the-rest-of-the-company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch got lots of love at Monitorama with a bunch of talks and workshops discussing it. This talk focused on it’s use for storing logs, looking at a number of tools for getting information in and out and some common configuration issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/reyjrar/elasticsearch-for-logging&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/reyjrar/elasticsearch-for-logging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A talk about some of the limitations of common monitoring approaches, and some examples of a new clojure based toolset that aims to fix some of them. Includes a nice conceptual model of a modern monitoring setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerd.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/9ac7b2e004310131954556f7ac4f018a/Eventoverse_Monitorama.pdf&quot;&gt;https://speakerd.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/9ac7b2e004310131954556f7ac4f018a/Eventoverse_Monitorama.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice writeup of the two days of the conference, mentioning a few of the talks and general themes that emerged over the course of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.endpoint.com/2013/09/monitorama-berlin-eu-day-1.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.endpoint.com/2013/09/monitorama-berlin-eu-day-1.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.endpoint.com/2013/09/monitorama-berlin-eu-day-2-and-final.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.endpoint.com/2013/09/monitorama-berlin-eu-day-2-and-final.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omnibus is a tool for building monolithic system packages, where you include everything including any dependencies. It’s a great way of distributing software with complex dependencies in a simple way. This presentation explains why and how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/lusis/the-magic-omnibus&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/lusis/the-magic-omnibus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good post about why, as an infrastructure engineer, you might also be well suited to running your own company or service given the high demand for infrastructure skills at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boundary.com/blog/2013/09/16/the-infrastructure-engineers-guide-to-entrepreneurship/&quot;&gt;http://boundary.com/blog/2013/09/16/the-infrastructure-engineers-guide-to-entrepreneurship/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting discussion of why high availability isn’t always worth the cost and additional complexity, and why many of the solutions to availability are centred around people and processes not technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iheavy.com/2012/04/01/the-myth-of-five-nines-why-high-availability-is-overrated/&quot;&gt;http://www.iheavy.com/2012/04/01/the-myth-of-five-nines-why-high-availability-is-overrated/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good introduction to getting started with Test Kitchen, an integration testing tool ideal for testing configuration management code across multiple local virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nistu.de/2013/09/21/getting-started-with-test-kitchen&quot;&gt;http://blog.nistu.de/2013/09/21/getting-started-with-test-kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A claim that releasing software (in this case Python packages, but it’s a general point) is normal too hard. Shows examples of the OpenStack toolchain which simplifies this, and lots of good comments with tools that can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://alexgaynor.net/2013/sep/17/doing-release-too-hard/&quot;&gt;http://alexgaynor.net/2013/sep/17/doing-release-too-hard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Summit Europe is an event covering training and presentations on the NoSQL database Cassandra. Held on 16th and 17th October in London, the conference will include presentations from Hailo, NetFlix and Spotify on their use of Cassandra, as well as sessions on the recent launch of Cassandra 2.0 by apache Cassandra chair Jonathan Ellis. The first 15 people to use the code DevopsWeekly will get 15% off the ticket price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datastax.com/cassandraeurope2013&quot;&gt;http://www.datastax.com/cassandraeurope2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Config Management Camp is going to be held on the 3rd and 4th of February next year in Gent, Belgium. Expect discussion and participation from Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt, CFEngine and more. It is cunningly just after FOSDEM too so why not extend your stay for a few days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/&quot;&gt;http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m seeing lots of interest in simple roll-your-own Platform as a Service tools at the moment. AWSBox uses EC2 to make creating a node.js specific PaaS simple, based on some of the open source nodejitsu tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/awsbox&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mozilla/awsbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting tool in the roll-your-own PaaS space is OSv. It basically does away with the operating system layer, running a JVM directly on top of the underlying hypervisor. Currently supports Xen, KVM and EC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://osv.io/&quot;&gt;http://osv.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioned in one of the Monitorama talks, es-utils provides a bunch of handy utility scripts for managing an elasticsearch cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reyjrar/es-utils&quot;&gt;https://github.com/reyjrar/es-utils&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 141 &amp;ndash; 15th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the second Monitorama conference this coming week so hopefully lots of monitoring related content next weekend. If the last one in Boston was anything to go it should be a pretty special event. If you’re going to be in Berlin let me know on twitter @garethr, I’m arriving Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A presentation from Surge all about engineering management. Loads of good content in here about organisational structures which tend to put software developer off your company, as well as discussion of incentive and job titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/surge2013&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/surge2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great story of optimising a web stack. Stepping through an existing architecture, load testing to find bottlenecks and then the changes that worked and didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://making.fiftythree.com/load-testing-an-unexpected-journey/&quot;&gt;http://making.fiftythree.com/load-testing-an-unexpected-journey/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good video of a talk all about notable devops culture traits. Good examples from specific companies, including Netflix and IBM, as well as a quick introduction to Deming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/2013/09/john-willis-notes-notable-devops-culture-traits/&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/2013/09/john-willis-notes-notable-devops-culture-traits/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog post about integrating a bunch of monitoring tools together, in this case statsd, graphite, nagios and sentry. A good tale of increasing the visibility of a system, making finding and fixing issues quicker and easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/attachmentsme/developer-blog/blob/master/quantified-site.md&quot;&gt;https://github.com/attachmentsme/developer-blog/blob/master/quantified-site.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing secrets when using configuration management tools is important, and this detailed walk through of using chef-vault is a great starting point for any Chef users. Lots of code examples and demonstrations of using the knife plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2013/09/10/managing-secrets-with-chef-vault/&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2013/09/10/managing-secrets-with-chef-vault/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick survey of the state of package management tools and how people are using them. I’ll hopefully post a link to the results too once they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/p/650ca4810c32&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/p/650ca4810c32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an interest in distributed systems then you’ve probably found yourself reading an academic paper or two. This curated list looks like an excellent starting point for a deep dive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://christophermeiklejohn.com/distributed/systems/2013/07/12/readings-in-distributed-systems.html&quot;&gt;http://christophermeiklejohn.com/distributed/systems/2013/07/12/readings-in-distributed-systems.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting approach to internal service communications using AMQP, and specifically RabbitMQ. The post describes a Ruby implementation and shows some examples, but the conventions could be adopted by any language or framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/hutch-inter-service-communication-with-rabbitmq/&quot;&gt;https://gocardless.com/blog/hutch-inter-service-communication-with-rabbitmq/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful diagram highlighting that different parts of the stack, from hardware and OS up to application code and configuration, change at different rates. I’d love to see actual real world data on this to back up the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.urbancode.com/uncategorized/the-many-layers-of-devops-2/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.urbancode.com/uncategorized/the-many-layers-of-devops-2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup of the advantages of adding testing to configuration management code, in this case focusing on the evolution of the Riak chef cookbook and the testing tools used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://basho.com/the-evolution-of-bashos-chef-cookbook/&quot;&gt;http://basho.com/the-evolution-of-bashos-chef-cookbook/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London based DevOps consultancy The Scale Factory are looking to expand their team.  If you&amp;rsquo;d like to work on challenging infrastructure problems across a range of different businesses, you can find more details at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scalefactory.com/team/careers&quot;&gt;http://www.scalefactory.com/team/careers&lt;/a&gt; or you can find @jtopper on Twitter or ##infra-talk&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ventriloquist is a new tool which combines vagrant and docker to make building development environments with dependencies easier. It’s implemented as a vagrant provisioner which can make use of a bunch of pre-build docker images t provide common services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/09/11/announcing-ventriloquist/&quot;&gt;http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/09/11/announcing-ventriloquist/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fgrehm/ventriloquist&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fgrehm/ventriloquist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batou looks like an interesting tool for service deployment. It aims to mix the simplicity of tools like Fabric with a more model driven idempotent system like Puppet or Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://batou.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;http://batou.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectd3 is a tool which takes information from collectd and visualises it using the D3 library, providing some nice graphics as well as a bird-eye view of multy-server system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StackStorm/collectd3&quot;&gt;https://github.com/StackStorm/collectd3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 140 &amp;ndash; 8th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad range of things under the Devops banner is becoming more and more apparent to me as I read everything from articles in Wired to white papers from enterprise consultancy firms to code on GitHub. The fact a genuine community still exists around things like Devops Days and small personal blogs is pretty impressive if you ask me. Thanks to everyone who makes that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops is increasingly being mentioned in notable places away from it’s humble beginnings. Here’s a good article in Wired no-less. Useful for those cases where someone suggests you’re just making all of this stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/06/building-a-healthy-devops-culture/&quot;&gt;http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/06/building-a-healthy-devops-culture/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice overview of tools and dashboards that the team at Stack Exchange have developed. Of particular interest is that many of these are build for running and managing Windows environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.serverfault.com/2013/09/05/homegrown-devops-tools-at-stack-exchange/&quot;&gt;http://blog.serverfault.com/2013/09/05/homegrown-devops-tools-at-stack-exchange/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good argument that for Devops approaches to succeed across large organisations we need to adjust how we consider certain aspects, in light of looking at the difference between utility and value added services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://niek.bartholomeus.be/2013/07/09/why-we-need-a-special-flavor-of-devops-for-mature-it/&quot;&gt;http://niek.bartholomeus.be/2013/07/09/why-we-need-a-special-flavor-of-devops-for-mature-it/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good write-up of instrumenting a new application using StatsD and Graphite. Examples of dashboards, and how they changed over time, as well as some more specific python and django hints and tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jupo.org/2013/08/29/devops-eye-for-the-coding-guy-metrics/&quot;&gt;http://blog.jupo.org/2013/08/29/devops-eye-for-the-coding-guy-metrics/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the interest around building tools on top of Docker at the moment a new repository has been created to try and list all of them in once place. If you’re interested in Docker then take a look at the Dockerforge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dockerforge&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dockerforge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good critique of the recent Facebook paper about how they deliver software to production. It’s opinionated in a few places but does a good job of highlighting some of the main areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swreflections.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/this-is-how-facebook-develops-and.html&quot;&gt;http://swreflections.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/this-is-how-facebook-develops-and.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another upcoming Devops Days events, this one in Portland on November 4th and 5th. Registration and a call for proposals are both open, with the CFP closing on October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-portland/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-portland/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More of the community orientated PuppetCamp events coming up in Washington, Berlin, London and Munich over the next few months. You can get all the details, and submit proposals for many of them at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/fall-puppet-camps-are-coming-and-were-looking-speakers&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/fall-puppet-camps-are-coming-and-were-looking-speakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sovereign is an integrated set of components for building your own self-hosted replacement for popular cloud services. So email, calendars, file storage, text hosting, vpn, irc, etc. It’s also a nice example of using Ansible which might be a good way of learning the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/al3x/sovereign&quot;&gt;https://github.com/al3x/sovereign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparkey is a simple constant key/value storage library, for read-heavy systems with infrequent large bulk inserts. It’s basically a very fast low overhead disk-backed hashtable and has been developed at Spotify for some interesting usecases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spotify/sparkey&quot;&gt;https://github.com/spotify/sparkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travis has become a really useful part of the open source ecosystem, but if you have a powerful local machine anyway it can be useful to run a full matrix build locally before pushing your code. Enter wwtd, or what would travis do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/grosser/wwtd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/grosser/wwtd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitorama in Boston was amazing. Huge thanks to Jason Dixon and everyone else involved who organised, attended or sponsored the event. If you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in monitoring I&amp;rsquo;d probably recommend skipping this entire issue, if not the links, presentations and new tools should keep you buys. Even the jobs are with folks who were at monitorama. See everyone in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Monitorama&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the huge amount of content from monitorama in this issue makes you wish you had made it along then you might be in luck. Monitorama is coming to Europe, Berlin, later this year. Sign up for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://monitorama.eu/&quot;&gt;http://monitorama.eu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A talk in the style of an essay, this one on Monitoring for humans. A good account of the status quo, lot of improvements to the technology and tools, but not as much discussion of what makes a good check or what makes a worthwhile alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/3/28/monitoring-for-humans.html&quot;&gt;http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/3/28/monitoring-for-humans.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides from one of the workshops held on the second day. These are from the statsd workshop, providing a quick introduction, showing examples, talking a little about writing backends and suggesting a few nice future enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/mrtazz/statsd-workshop-monitorama-2013&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/mrtazz/statsd-workshop-monitorama-2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An entertaining run through the state of monitoring, focusing on a few areas where we could be doing a lot better or thinking about a lot more; for instance security, data retention, alert fatigue, visualisation patterns and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More slides from monitorama, these ones from Dr Neil Gunther. Features a great history of monitoring and lots of science and statistics which we should be applying to our tools and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The videos from Devopsdays London are all up now. Lots of good talks worth watching, in particular if you&amp;rsquo;re interested or working in a large organisation as that turned out to be something of a theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/album/2312414&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/album/2312414&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good list of things to consider when writing configuration management code, aimed at preventing a proliferation of very similar modules and improving prospects for sharing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re into podcasts then here&amp;rsquo;s another one to add to the growing webops/devops shows. We love monitoring is a podcast dedicated to all things monitoring. The organisers are looking for people to go on the show too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.welovemonitoring.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.welovemonitoring.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article positing that we need to see much better ways of testing performance and scalability in a world of continuous deployment. The comments are interesting too, mainly highlighting resistance to the idea within large enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/make-performance-and-scalability-testing-continuous-or-else-212804&quot;&gt;http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/make-performance-and-scalability-testing-continuous-or-else-212804&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A follow up to a previous article, about problems that occur if you take a pipeline approach to monitoring. Specifically, the case with checks that are based on collected metrics, and the different failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2013/03/25/data-failures-compartments-pipelines/&quot;&gt;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2013/03/25/data-failures-compartments-pipelines/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help build the platform that powers a better, fairer banking experience at Simple. Join a talented team that chooses its own tools (and open sources new ones); works across web, Android, iOS, and Ruby/Scala/Clojure backend apps; and develops a secure and scalable banking service on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT Lincoln Laboratory is currently looking for a student enrolled in college to do a paid internship/co-op in our Advanced Technologies division. This is a great opportunity to get your feet wet in a role that encourages creative approaches to operations work. You should already be pretty comfortable with Linux environments for this internship, and be familiar with the configuration management platforms such as Puppet. Knowing a language (like PERL, Ruby, Python, PHP) is also useful, as we&amp;rsquo;ve got a variety of user-facing and internal tools that could use some improvement. Unfortunately, due to the nature of Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s work, this internship requires US Citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/llr4207&quot;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/llr4207&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the talks at Monitorama, from Jesse Newland from GitHub, talked quite a bit about their new pagerduty integration with their hubot chat bot, and how it helped with being on call. The code for that plugin is now open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/858&quot;&gt;https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/858&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman is a dashboard for puppet reports, based on information sent to logstash and stored in elasticsearch. If you&amp;rsquo;re already using Forman, but only for the report dashboard this might be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/youdevise/norman&quot;&gt;https://github.com/youdevise/norman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the monitorama hackday projects was a way to build resilience into statsd using a proxy with a consistent hashing ring. Described as a proof of concept at the moment but we saw this working on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/statsd/pull/284&quot;&gt;https://github.com/etsy/statsd/pull/284&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dashing is a new dashboard framework from Shopify. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Ruby and Coffeescript, already has impressive looking documentation and a good demo, and looks a great way of quickly building attractive dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shopify.github.com/dashing/&quot;&gt;http://shopify.github.com/dashing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to update your TV screen dashboards using your chat bot? Crimson Twins is used by Mozilla to do just that, allowing you to easily change what&amp;rsquo;s been shown on your dashboards based on what is relevant to the issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mythmon/crimsontwins&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mythmon/crimsontwins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixing business metrics with operational data is a great way of fostering collaboration and helps with prioritising the right things. Anthracite is a simple dashboard tool for submitting and showing those events, with nice graphite integration so you can mix this data into your existing metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 116 &amp;ndash; 24th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next weeks devopsweekly might be a little late. It might also be jam-packed with monitoring content. I&amp;rsquo;m heading over to Boston for the amazing looking Monitorama for most of next week, but for most of Sunday I&amp;rsquo;ll be on a plane. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be in Boston too then come say Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of building up a monitoring stack from many individual components and a pipeline isn&amp;rsquo;t new, but this is the best explanation for why this is probably the best approach to take. Explains the pros and cons in a clear way, along with good diagrams explaining the how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2013/03/22/monitoring-pipelines/&quot;&gt;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2013/03/22/monitoring-pipelines/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent scares around RubyGems have increased awareness of a little used feature, signed gems. Bundler, the popular ruby gem dependency manager has added a feature to make using signed gems easier, and this post explains how to use it. The state of signing on ruby gems isn&amp;rsquo;t great, but it might be something to bug people upstream about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.meldium.com/home/2013/3/3/signed-rubygems-part&quot;&gt;http://blog.meldium.com/home/2013/3/3/signed-rubygems-part&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the talks that got lots of people talking at Devopsdays London was &amp;ldquo;Devops in the hell of a thousand different platforms&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s part case study about software development in a large, fragmented organisation and part hints and tips for making it better. In particular the presentation talks about the power of message queues to power interoperability and standardisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/sameaton/devops-in-the-hell-of-a-thousand-different-platforms&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/sameaton/devops-in-the-hell-of-a-thousand-different-platforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open space sessions are a great place to have important conversations, and this session on Women in DevOps from Devopsdays London was definitely one of those. These notes touch on some of the points discussed, and have a few suggestions for future Devopsdays (and other) events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/tomduckering/5185986&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/tomduckering/5185986&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two more blog posts covering Devopsdays London, featuring notes from the open spaces and general thoughts and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://matstace.me.uk/blog/2013/03/devopsdayslondonmarch2013/&quot;&gt;http://matstace.me.uk/blog/2013/03/devopsdayslondonmarch2013/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed getting started with Chef post, taking you from first install to running a wordpress instance powered by Chef. A good starting point, or a good way of catching up if you haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at Chef for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gettingstartedwithchef.com/&quot;&gt;http://gettingstartedwithchef.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article about some of the resistance to automation ad devops in some organisations. Covers a few possible issues and talks about how it really is all about getting the culture right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newtoniannuggets.com/2013/03/14/3-reasons-why-devops-isnt-changing-it-faster/&quot;&gt;http://newtoniannuggets.com/2013/03/14/3-reasons-why-devops-isnt-changing-it-faster/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice write-up of getting started with Ansible, the Python based configuration management tool. A good first use experience is important and it looks like Ansible makes getting started fast and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kafecho.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/using-ansible-for-configuration.html&quot;&gt;http://kafecho.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/using-ansible-for-configuration.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in London on April 9th then you might be interested in MongoDB London. The schedule is already available and includes 5 tracks of introductory and advanced talks. The London Sharded Pub Crawl is back from last year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-london-2013&quot;&gt;http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-london-2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riak Cloud Storage is an object storage system built on top of Riak with an S3-compatible interface. If you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way to run your own object store this might be something worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://basho.com/riak-cs-is-now-open-source/&quot;&gt;http://basho.com/riak-cs-is-now-open-source/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/basho/riak_cs&quot;&gt;https://github.com/basho/riak_cs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are using Vagrant and configuration management tools now to power development environments, and Opskeleton aims to be an opinionated packaging of some of these tools (vagrant, puppet, librarian-puppet, git) into an off-the-shelf development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 115 &amp;ndash; 17th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last two days helping to organise the excellent Devopsdays conference in London. From the feedback I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far everyone had as good a time as me, thanks again to all the sponsors, speakers and attendees who made the event awesome. If you&amp;rsquo;re part of this community you should think about getting along to a near-by event, or even getting together with a few people to organise something. Putting lots of smart, passionate people together in one place really is a great way of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Devopsdays London&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice write-up of all the sessions, along with some thoughts about the format of the two days. Lots of links to slides, books and other resources mentioned in the talks and open space sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/review-of-devopsdays-london-2013/&quot;&gt;http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/review-of-devopsdays-london-2013/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the open space sessions I attended was all about community resources for learning about Devops. These notes from the person who ran the session are a great resource on their own, with links to events, podcasts, blogs, books and even this newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://annaken.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/devops-community-resources.html&quot;&gt;http://annaken.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/devops-community-resources.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides from one of the Devopsdays London talks, this one from Niek Bartholomeus all about Devops for Dinosaurs. The topic is all about bringing devops culture and modern tooling to a large enterprise environment, based on a great in-depth case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/niekbartho/devops-for-dinosaurs&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/niekbartho/devops-for-dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the Devopsdays London presentation that I&amp;rsquo;ve found, this one from Gene Kim all about how best to sell your boss or your organisation on adopting devops. Mapping business failings to developer failings looks a great way to get different people to understand the problem from their own point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/realgenekim/how-can-we-better-sell-devops&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/realgenekim/how-can-we-better-sell-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More notes from Devopsdays London, this time covering all the talks and ignites. The notes are drawn from tweets made during the talks, but you can follow along with the topics surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scribes.tweetscriber.com/RealGeneKim/114&quot;&gt;http://scribes.tweetscriber.com/RealGeneKim/114&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ignite talks, entitled What if configuration management was created by game designers. Lots of interesting ideas, from rewards, high scores, virtual currency, cheats, health and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/what-ifconfigmgtwasdesignedbygamers&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/what-ifconfigmgtwasdesignedbygamers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people might remember Flapjack, which aimed to be a next generation monitoring tool. Due to various reasons it has been superceded by tools like Sensu which have a similar focus. Well now Flapjack has been rebooted, aimed at being the part of the monitoring puzzle that deals with alerts, roll-ups and notifications. Well worth talking a look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2013/03/15/rebooting-flapjack/&quot;&gt;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2013/03/15/rebooting-flapjack/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker is the soon to be open sourced container runtime from the folks at dotcloud. It&amp;rsquo;s aim is to be a building block for building isolated runtime environments, using LXC under the hood to isolate everything and hopefully provide a general approach to specific tools like virtualenv, rvm gemsets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dotcloud.github.com/docker/&quot;&gt;http://dotcloud.github.com/docker/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m finding quite a few presentations and videos about practical scaling tips for small companies, most of them quite rightly focusing as much on not doing some things and what to do. This talk from Ruby Australia focuses on Rails, but nearly all the advice should be applicable to any startup or small company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/61342269&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/61342269&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting presentation from the development team at SoundCloud about how they are migrating away from monolithic Rails applications to a running small services on the JVM as they grow. Lots of good tips and experience, in particular about making the cost of experimenting low &amp;ndash; they are currently using JRuby, Scala and Clojure to find which fits best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/pcalcado/from-a-monolithic-ruby-on-rails-app-to-the-jvm&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/pcalcado/from-a-monolithic-ruby-on-rails-app-to-the-jvm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting survey results about barriers to adopting a continuous delivery model. Findings include organisational culture, lack of integrated development and operations, technical hurdles and a general lack of understanding. Worth reading some of the conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.devopsguys.com/2013/03/13/continuous-delivery-adoption-barriers/&quot;&gt;http://blog.devopsguys.com/2013/03/13/continuous-delivery-adoption-barriers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HotelTonight offers last-minute deals at top-rated hotels screened by the HT team and lets you book a room in seconds flat.  In less than 2 years, we grew from 3 cities in the US to over 90 destinations in 10 countries. We are named one of the most disruptive services of the year by Apple in 2012 and named Top Developer on Google Play. We are looking for a talented DevOps engineer in San Francisco to build out a new stack on AWS using Chef and scale the system as we offer the service to more people in more places. Ideally, you can help us open source as much of this as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=od9aXfwd&amp;amp;s=morethanseven&quot;&gt;http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=od9aXfwd&amp;amp;s=morethanseven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neo Technology, the people who make Neo4j, the world’s leading graph database, are looking for engineers to join the team. You are enquiring and thoughtful and have great Puppet and Ruby skills. If you roll with Python or Chef and have an open mind, we’ll take a look at your cookbooks and your indenting. You will help build and support Neo4j in the Cloud as part of a global team and work with leading-edge technologies: Puppet, AWS, Ruby, New Relic, and other tools from the DevOps community. You’ll get to help shape our global operation and discover the delights of Swedish Kaffebröd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the tools mentioned in a talk at Devopsdays London was Deploykit, from Future publishing. The talk went into more detail but this was an attempt to make a generic deployment tool that uses message queues for much of the internal communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FuturePublishing/future-deploykit&quot;&gt;https://github.com/FuturePublishing/future-deploykit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagabond is an alternative take on the Vagrant tool, but one based on LXC rather than virtual machines after the realisation that VMs can be quite slow. Maybe worth a look if you run Linux and find lots of performance or stability issues with virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer tools but an awful lot to read this week, including a few short books available for free online. If you skip everything else or just skim the outlines I&amp;rsquo;d definitely read the first article in full. Then read it again and think about how it applies to our domain of fast moving technology, and more importantly how we avoid the need for too much devops archaeology in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first article doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to have anything to do with devops. It&amp;rsquo;s about institutional memory, engineering archaeology, documentation and document management. It&amp;rsquo;s about a chemical engineering plant. But I bet most people can read this and see it either in their past or future when it comes to the computer system we build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Platform as a Service is generally made up of quite a few interesting moving parts. This free book (available online or to download) covers some of the dotcloud details, but much of the software discussed is open source. Some good low level resource management and file system stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice write-up of continuous deployment from an individual developers perspective. I particularly liked the like &amp;ldquo;The real secret to the success of continuous deployment is that code is pushed before it’s done&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone running real life systems will get reports of errors from users or the code itself at some point, and not all error reports are useful (to put it politely). This post covers a manifesto for error reporting, with several good tips worth considering next time you write error handling code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chef 11 has some awesome new features, but unless you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along closely you might have some work to do to resolve some breaking changes. Here&amp;rsquo;s a good walk though of a few of the gotchas that should see you on Chef 11 in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the potential security risks of browser based applications can be quite a challenge, their are quite a few odd attack vectors and things people place too much trust in (third party javascript anyone?). This excellent on-line book has a wealth of information about all things browser and security. Well worth a read. I just wish I could find a good ebook version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging is a source of lots of interesting and useful information, but getting the right setup for you can take time. Here&amp;rsquo;s five simple steps to make your application logging better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armatures is a new community project from Puppetlabs which aims to provide a way for people to suggest proposals to enhance or add features to Puppet or something in the Puppet ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;s just a GitHub repo and the first armature documents the process to follow to make proposals. Interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As vagrant becomes more and more useful and powerful you can spend too long typing in those commands. Fear not, here is a much improved set of scripts for bash completion for vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rjw1/vagrant-bash-completion&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rjw1/vagrant-bash-completion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaughter is a configuration management system written in Perl, with a pretty comprehensive set of documentation. it was inspired by CFEngine, with the supplied primitives being very similar, but with the client-server model replaced by a more flexible system of transports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 113 &amp;ndash;  3rd March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conference season appears to have started in earnest again, which makes finding good content that little bit easier. Quite a few presentations this week, and with lots more events coming up (see the excellent list compiled by the folks from Melbourne in this issue) we can hopefully expect many more. If you see any good presentations be sure to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice folks from Melbourne&amp;rsquo;s devops meetup, infrastructure coders, have created a list of interesting devops events from all around the world. They are looking for pull requests to keep it up to date too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://infrastructurecoders.com/events.html&quot;&gt;http://infrastructurecoders.com/events.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presentation from the recent Scale conference all about logstash from the projects creator. Mainly a good introduction, but includes a great case study from Dreamhost about improving customer support using the power of logs an dgood tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-scale11x/&quot;&gt;http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-scale11x/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Scale presentation, this one all about low level tools you can use to analyse the performance of linux. A rapid fire introduction to top, htop, iostat, free, ping, dstat, sar, strace, tcpdump, SystemTap, DTrace and many more. Available as both the slides and the video too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joyent.com/blog/linux-performance-analysis-and-tools-brendan-gregg-s-talk-at-scale-11x&quot;&gt;http://joyent.com/blog/linux-performance-analysis-and-tools-brendan-gregg-s-talk-at-scale-11x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article from Yahoo about how they are working on the processing of large datasets, and how in many cases mapreduce/hadoop/batch processing don&amp;rsquo;t cut it. Some interesting dicussion of using Strom for stream processing alongside data in HDFS/HBase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2013/02/storm-and-hadoop-convergence-of-big-data-and-low-latency-processing/&quot;&gt;http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2013/02/storm-and-hadoop-convergence-of-big-data-and-low-latency-processing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good post from Forrester about the problems with some private cloud roll-outs in large organisations. The points about putting users first make me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.forrester.com/james_staten/13-02-25-why_your_enterprise_private_cloud_is_failing&quot;&gt;http://blogs.forrester.com/james_staten/13-02-25-why_your_enterprise_private_cloud_is_failing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging is important, but can involve more moving parts than it first appears. This post covers quite a specific question, but the answer includes a wide range of handy information about file handles, pipes, log rotation and more. Worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/blog/2013_02/dear-nic-says-jim&quot;&gt;http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/blog/2013_02/dear-nic-says-jim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A presentation from last year all about infrastructure in startups, or really about any infrastructure in young projects in any organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulhammond.org/2012/startup-infrastructure/slides/&quot;&gt;http://www.paulhammond.org/2012/startup-infrastructure/slides/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buildpacks are a fantastic way of extending Heroku (and soon Cloudfoundry). This one gives you your own personal ruby gems server, which might be of interest if you have private gems or you like that little bit of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/heroku-buildpack-rubygem-server&quot;&gt;https://github.com/hashicorp/heroku-buildpack-rubygem-server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliver looks an interesting (and very colourful) deployment tool based purely around Git and bash. Not needing Ruby or Python or another programming language appears to be it&amp;rsquo;s main selling point but it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity might be great for smaller projects or teams using different technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gerhard/deliver&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gerhard/deliver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mcollective is incredibly powerful, but the different moving parts can make trying it out tricky. This vagrant based demo is therefore hugely welcome. By default it fires up a 6 node cluster, all configured to use mcollective and a range of plugins. The README then takes you through the different capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ripienaar/mcollective-vagrant&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ripienaar/mcollective-vagrant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the longest newsletter this week but lots of really good, well written, detailed posts that deserve reading. It&amp;rsquo;s nearly March, which means it&amp;rsquo;s just about time for QCon and Devopsdays in London and Monitorama in Boston, all of which I&amp;rsquo;m going to make it along to. Any readers going along to any of those events let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic post about culture. This isn&amp;rsquo;t specific to devops or in my experience technology companies based in San Francisco or anywhere else. Read this, think about where you work and consider what you could do to make things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.prettylittlestatemachine.com/blog/2013/02/20/what-your-culture-really-says/&quot;&gt;http://blog.prettylittlestatemachine.com/blog/2013/02/20/what-your-culture-really-says/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using Ruby you&amp;rsquo;re hopefully familiar with the recent spate of security vulnerabilities in various gems. This appears to have sparked lots of useful tooling and conversations, including this post which describes a way of checking your Gemfile from bundler for gems with known issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://psionides.eu/2013/02/18/pick-holes-in-your-gemfiles/&quot;&gt;http://psionides.eu/2013/02/18/pick-holes-in-your-gemfiles/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent post about how Heroku deals with load balancing requests kicked up lots of discussion. This post explains exactly how you can predict and design systems for traffic routing, and it does so all in code. Timeline is a network simulator written in clojure and is well worth experimenting with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aphyr.com/posts/277-timelike-a-network-simulator&quot;&gt;http://aphyr.com/posts/277-timelike-a-network-simulator&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what is looking like a great series of articles, this second post about devops in a traditional enterprise organisation does into details about how a software group might be structured. It identifies different teams, and points out some of the problems that most similar organisations face. The next posts promise to look at solutions. Worth keeping an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://niek.bartholomeus.be/2013/02/20/a-closer-look-at-introducing-devops-in-a-traditional-enterprise/&quot;&gt;http://niek.bartholomeus.be/2013/02/20/a-closer-look-at-introducing-devops-in-a-traditional-enterprise/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZooKeeper has lots of interesting use-cases around application deployment, orchestration and infrastructure management. But it also has a reputation as being large and complex. This post looks like a great introduction to installing a single node and using the client to store and retrieve data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/02/how-to-use-apache-zookeeper-to-build-distributed-apps-and-why/&quot;&gt;http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/02/how-to-use-apache-zookeeper-to-build-distributed-apps-and-why/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opinionated take on 12 devops anti-patterns. Everything from the devops team to replacing operations staff with developers to the relationship with agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.devopsguys.com/2013/02/20/twelve-devops-anti-patterns/&quot;&gt;http://blog.devopsguys.com/2013/02/20/twelve-devops-anti-patterns/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opsworks is the latest addition to the Amazon Web Services suite. It provides a nicely integrated provisioning environment based on Chef and the EC2 API. If you find elasticbeanstalk not flexible enough, but feel like you&amp;rsquo;re reinventing the wheel using the low level EC2 API then this might be the perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/&quot;&gt;http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;zkwatcher, and the related puppet_zkwatcher, are a nice looking solution to storing the list of available services and hosts in Zookeeper, and then using that information in Puppet. This avoids hard coding host information in your configuration management code. The supporting blog post explains how and gives a more detailed walk through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This community grew partly out of the first devopsdays event in Ghent. Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/&lt;/a&gt; now you&amp;rsquo;ll see 14 events this year organised already, from Europe and the US all the way to Brazil, India, Tokyo and New Zealand. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty impressive. Thanks to all the people involved in organising those events, hopefully their is a good cross over between attendees and readers of this newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to use the Vagrant workflow with something other than VirtualBox? Work has been ongoing to support multiple providers for a while, and code and demos can be found with Vagrant working with VMWare Fusion. But this post, a demo of the upcoming 1.1 release, shows Vagrant working with EC2. Ideal for those times when your local machine can&amp;rsquo;t run all those virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/preview-vagrant-aws.html&quot;&gt;http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/preview-vagrant-aws.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article explaining why devops is needed, and predicting big inroads in traditional enterprises in 2013. The $440 million loss made by Knight Capital because of using the incorrect version of network softare might just be the best example of why good configuration management matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/behaviorally-speaking-2013-predictions-devops-and-it-operations&quot;&gt;http://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/behaviorally-speaking-2013-predictions-devops-and-it-operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever wanted a handy review of lots of the current crop of NoSQL databases then this post should come in useful. Good examples of common usecases as well as details of license, language, protocol and inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good reminder that rapid application development needs to consider it&amp;rsquo;s approach to security, because doing it after the fact is probably too late. I particularly liked the point that with iterative development and modern technology &amp;ldquo;you risk generating a considerable amount of insecure code very quickly&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wireharbor.com/2013/02/13/swift-development-cycles-dont-necessarily-mean-shoddy-security-outcomes/&quot;&gt;http://www.wireharbor.com/2013/02/13/swift-development-cycles-dont-necessarily-mean-shoddy-security-outcomes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good talk on the link between continuous integration and deploying code to production. Lots of good tips about build time, release frequency and building feedback into the build pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Continuous-Integration-Songkick&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Continuous-Integration-Songkick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chef is pretty flexible about how you accomplish your goals, which does mean it&amp;rsquo;s possible to do things in ways that might come back to bite you later. This post covers a few of those anti-patterns, including forking community cookbooks and misuse of roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/02/16/chef-cookbook-anti-patterns/&quot;&gt;http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/02/16/chef-cookbook-anti-patterns/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka, the distributed publish/subscribe middleware is getting a Intra-cluster Replication capability in the upcoming release. This post describes the details, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a good read if you have an interest in the design and trade-offs involved with building distributed, fault tolerant systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good read on distributed systems, this post covers a wealth of practical hard won wisdom aimed at people new to designing and developing distributed systems. Well worth reading all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots more devopsdays events coming up around the world, leaving even fewer excuses to go along and meet interesting people. With Paris on 18th and 19th April, Berlin 27th and 28th of May and Sydney on July 12th and 13th. All are open for registration and are looking for sponsors and talk proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub have open sourced Boxen, the puppet based tool chain they use to manage OSX based development machines. Lots of examples, insights into development at GitHub and good documentation to get started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fatcache says it&amp;rsquo;s memcached for SSDs. Memcached stores things in memory, which is great up until you have a huge amount of data and can&amp;rsquo;t afford the RAM. Fatcache uses a similar approach but stores things on SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 110 &amp;ndash;  10th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logstash, one of the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve featured quite a few times in this newsletter has a book available, and a self published one at that. I&amp;rsquo;d love to see more self publishing around emerging tools and topics from the devops community. Traditional publishing is hard in such a fast moving environment, but being able to read a book rather than a blog post can really help with understanding a new tool or topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logstash book has been released! I read this coming back from FOSDEM and it&amp;rsquo;s well worth spending some time with. It covers why log management is important, how to get started with logstash and just as interestingly how to scale up and how to make decisions about the different logstash components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.logstashbook.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.logstashbook.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform as a Service architectures are interesting (at least to me), and this post, the first in a series, starts to dissect the inner workings of CloudFoudry. This post covers how the application is run with lots of code examples and by running one of the CloudFoundry components on it&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://starkandwayne.com/articles/2013/02/05/diy-paas-running-apps-with-a-dea/&quot;&gt;http://starkandwayne.com/articles/2013/02/05/diy-paas-running-apps-with-a-dea/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goo list of handy one-liners for knife, the chef command line tool. A mix of search tips and exec hacks, if you understand all of these you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be able to adapt them for lots of other uses too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/02/03/knife-tricks/&quot;&gt;http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/02/03/knife-tricks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An old post (from 2009) but worth reading amongst the recent spate of vulnerabilities. This covers timing attacks, and is probably the clearest (and scariest) description I&amp;rsquo;ve read of what&amp;rsquo;s quite an interesting attack vector for certain systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/&quot;&gt;http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the skeptics are coming round to the Devops ideas it seems. Good post on how ITIL and other more traditional approaches can be seen in terms of Devops. Looking forward to more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itskeptic.org/content/unified-theory-itsm-reconciling-devops-and-itil&quot;&gt;http://www.itskeptic.org/content/unified-theory-itsm-reconciling-devops-and-itil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting presentation from the recent Monkigras conference, on what the big data and data science community can learn from the devops movement. The phrase &amp;ldquo;analysis as code&amp;rdquo; should hopefully stick in the same way as infrastructure as code has done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/dberkholz/data-science-devops-and-drinks-the-perfect-combination&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/dberkholz/data-science-devops-and-drinks-the-perfect-combination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another survey, this one focusing on operations productivity. It&amp;rsquo;s 25 questions and the plan is to release the resultings in a month or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/productivity-survey&quot;&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/productivity-survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good tips on network tuning, nginx configuration and debugging performance issues around a simple but high throughput node.js application. Most of it should be relevant for anyone proxying to evented applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.gosquared.com/optimising-nginx-node-js-and-networking-for-heavy-workloads&quot;&gt;https://engineering.gosquared.com/optimising-nginx-node-js-and-networking-for-heavy-workloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Gate Software are looking for a DevOps Engineer to join their team. In the next year, Red Gate&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure will undergo more change than in the previous five. They&amp;rsquo;re committed to the cloud, to the blurring of the line between developer and sysadmin, to automation and the move towards infrastructure as code, and to monitoring as the foundation of responsive infrastructure. If you&amp;rsquo;re some peripatetic hybrid of developer and sysadmin, imbued with a depth of understanding of how this cool stuff can work for a mature company, then go and help them build it. Simply upload your CV and cover letter to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/careers/current-opportunities/devops-engineer&quot;&gt;http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/careers/current-opportunities/devops-engineer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chef fundamentals training event is coming up on the 26th and 27th of February in Berlin. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested you can get a 75 Euro discount using the code CBCHEF-Q28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://de.amiando.com/cheftraining.html&quot;&gt;http://de.amiando.com/cheftraining.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting plugin for Vagrant. This uses the ZFS filesystem to make snapshots of virtual machines, and claims to drastically improve the first boot time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/larstobi/vagrant-zfs&quot;&gt;https://github.com/larstobi/vagrant-zfs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monigusto is an integrated suite of monitoring tools, packaged as a series of Chef recipes and a vagrant configuration. It looks a great starting point if you want to experiment with a pre-configured monitoring stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/monigusto&quot;&gt;https://github.com/monigusto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2013/02/03/109/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 109 &amp;ndash;  3rd February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue is coming live from FOSDEM in Brussels, which makes gathering interesting content from the past week quite easy. The sheer number of talks and new open source tools being discussed or released means I&amp;rsquo;m bound to have missed something though. Special mention to the folks behind both the Configuration Management and the Testing and Automation rooms yesterday for lots of good content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the talks from the Configuration Management room delved into how we learn to automate. Taking examples from training materials and community efforts and summing up with some support projects can provide to help people adopt them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/nathenharvey/learning-to-automate&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/nathenharvey/learning-to-automate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another talk from the Configuration Management room, this one focusing on integration testing for Infrastructure. It introduces the new Test Kitchen framework, which aims to be a tool agnostic way of building repeatable tests for infrastructure and configuration management code. Lots of good ideas in here that should probably exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/bryanwb/dont-shrug-integration-testing-for-infrastructure-with-ruby-frameworks&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/bryanwb/dont-shrug-integration-testing-for-infrastructure-with-ruby-frameworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was from the Testing and Automation dev room. It covers building a continuous integration pipeline for building system packages and introduces a number of small tools that can be composed together for the intended purpose. The Gist contains notes and links to all the tools mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/mpasternacki/a-continuous-packaging-pipeline&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/mpasternacki/a-continuous-packaging-pipeline&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle are looking for people to join their Cloud Operations team to help run Oracle RightNow CX, a complex  LAMP-based SaaS platform running on thousands of globally distributes nodes. We do DevOps, we do continuous integration, we do configuration management and we do big data. We don&amp;rsquo;t do boring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/12jScvL&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/12jScvL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomsons Online Benefits (Victoria, London, UK) are recruiting a DevOps Build Engineer. DevOps is a new team in Thomsons with a focus on supporting faster, more frequent and more robust deployments of our product: Darwin. This team has in-roads to Development, QA and IT Operations and owns the Release Management function. We need someone who can help us push automation for test and deployment as well as help us manage our builds and releases. We&amp;rsquo;re run Windows, MSSQL and IIS and code in C++ and ASP.Net using TFS, Jenkins and Powershell to automate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect candidate would have been exposed to the SDLC, Agile practices and cloud infrastructure. Previous automation experience is a must. If you enjoy a challenge and want to help define what DevOps means to Thomsons then this might be the perfect job for you. Give us a shout at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x63;&amp;#114;&amp;#117;&amp;#x69;&amp;#116;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#116;&amp;#x40;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#99;&amp;#x72;&amp;#117;&amp;#105;&amp;#x74;&amp;#109;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x40;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#115;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&lt;/a&gt; and mention DevOps in the subject line. You can find more about us at www.thomsons.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great, long and detailed writeup of why the recent Ruby on Rails vulnerabilities matter to you whether you&amp;rsquo;re a Ruby/Rails shop or not. Lots of good, scary examples and lots of advice, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not up on security exploits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/01/31/what-the-rails-security-issue-means-for-your-startup/&quot;&gt;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/01/31/what-the-rails-security-issue-means-for-your-startup/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good talk on GitHub culture. The main take away surrounds how company structure is strongly linked with the prevailing culture of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/tnm/scaling-happiness&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/tnm/scaling-happiness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppetcamp Ghent happened just before FOSDEM and this talk quickly demonstrates how to manage puppet with mcollective. Enabling and disabling runs, ad-hoc puppet runs and managing deployments are all covered. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good short introduction to using mcollective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/PuppetLabs/presentation-16281121&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/PuppetLabs/presentation-16281121&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good week for epic blog posts. This one is a fantastic case study all about introducing a devops culture into a traditional enterprise. Lots to admire and lots more to learn from, whether you work in an enterprise environment or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://niek.bartholomeus.be/2013/01/28/introducing-a-devops-culture-in-a-traditional-enterprise/&quot;&gt;http://niek.bartholomeus.be/2013/01/28/introducing-a-devops-culture-in-a-traditional-enterprise/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending Nginx using Lua appears to be incredibly powerful, and real world tutorials like this one make a good case for investigating it for certain use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3scale.github.com/2013/01/09/augment-your-api-without-touching-it/&quot;&gt;http://3scale.github.com/2013/01/09/augment-your-api-without-touching-it/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up speaking to the author of OWASP Zed Attack Proxy on Friday at FOSDEM. It looks to be a great penetration and vulnerability testing tool, and one that lends itself to being used as part of a continuous integration setup. Version 2.0.0 has just been released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project&quot;&gt;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 108 &amp;ndash; 27th January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to the Belgium roadtrip this week. Puppetcamp, FOSDEM and the monitoringlove hack day one after the other. If anyone is going to be around Ghent, Brussels or Antwerp and wants to meet up let me know. I&amp;rsquo;ll try and get next weeks issue out when I can, but it will rely on me finding an internet connection so might be a little delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever been putting together a custom dashboard and needed a handy javascript library to help with the graphs, charts and other visualisations? This page collects a rather large number of tools together in one place, along with a hand sample image. No excuses for dashboards not being pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://selection.datavisualization.ch/&quot;&gt;http://selection.datavisualization.ch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good in-depth walkthrough of building a Jenkins pipeline to build vagrant boxes with veewee and upload them to S3. Covers all the pitfalls and provides simple instructions. A useful guide if you&amp;rsquo;re doing something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spilth.org/blog/2013/01/21/automated-vm-generation-with-veewee-jenkins-and-amazon-s3/&quot;&gt;http://spilth.org/blog/2013/01/21/automated-vm-generation-with-veewee-jenkins-and-amazon-s3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a recent devopsdays event someone put together a reading list of devops related books. Only one overly technical book too, with lots about process and organisation change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/30720.DevOps_Reading_List&quot;&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/30720.DevOps_Reading_List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of good talk about the role of being on-call recently. This blog post describes how a small startup have evolved their on-call rota and how they are now involving operations, developers and soon designers in the response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.serverdensity.com/how-we-handle-on-call-schedules/&quot;&gt;http://blog.serverdensity.com/how-we-handle-on-call-schedules/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good talk from the recent devopsdays conference by Dave Zwieback all about hiring people into roles in a devops minded organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/57926877&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/57926877&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting post about the difference between composable and contextual ways of extending tools. Some good points for anyone writing tools with APIs or wanting their tools to be extended, and for anyone who hates Maven and wonders why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/01/22/why_everyone_eventually_hates_maven.html&quot;&gt;http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/01/22/why_everyone_eventually_hates_maven.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripe is building next-generation infrastructure for online payments. We&amp;rsquo;re hiring engineers with operations experience to take our systems to the next level of scalability and reliability. If you love building high throughput, chaos monkey-proof systems; if you&amp;rsquo;ve built and maintained large software projects before; and if taking updates is a cathartic experience, then you should do-release-upgrade to Stripe. To apply, send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#58;&amp;#106;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x62;&amp;#115;&amp;#x2b;&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#111;&amp;#x70;&amp;#115;&amp;#x2d;&amp;#119;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6b;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#64;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x70;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&quot;&gt;&amp;#106;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#98;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x2b;&amp;#100;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x76;&amp;#111;&amp;#x70;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x2d;&amp;#x77;&amp;#101;&amp;#x65;&amp;#107;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#x40;&amp;#115;&amp;#x74;&amp;#114;&amp;#x69;&amp;#112;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#99;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt; with a description of your experience, relevant online handles, and anything else that would be useful for us to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ledbetter is a relatively simple nagios to graphite integration. It takes the state of various checks and servicegroups in nagios and exports that data to graphite with a script you can run on a cron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/ledbetter&quot;&gt;https://github.com/github/ledbetter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like open source projects that make it clear what license they are released under. But copying a file around into your repo is easy to forget to do. Lice solves that problem nicely with a command line tool that knows about lots of popular licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcarbaugh/lice&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jcarbaugh/lice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ybot is a hubot inspired chat bot which aims to be a platform for exposing data and commands in a central manner. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Erlang, but you can extend it with scripts in various languages including ruby, python, shell and perl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/0xAX/Ybot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/0xAX/Ybot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironfan is a Chef orchestration layer, providing lots of tools and knife extensions for managing a fleet of machines. What caught my eye this week was the walkthrough tool, which allows for using the chef DSL to define a set of virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan/wiki/walkthrough-web&quot;&gt;https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan/wiki/walkthrough-web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shameless promotion of something I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking on, very similar to the above ironfan example. A puppet module allowing for defining a set of virtual machines and load balancers from different cloud providers in the puppet DSL, and using an idempotent puppet run to ensure that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of the year has certainly got people busy. Lots of interesting tools and events in particular this week, so lots of opportunities to meet up with like minded folks wherever you are. Only two weeks to go too before the great Belgium devops roadtrip; PuppetCamp in Ghent, FOSDEM in Brussels and the monitoringlove hack day in Antwerp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every wondered about what to log? This post, the 10 commandments of logging, should be sent to every developer or web operations professional and used whenever the question comes up. Well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2013/01/13/the-10-commandments-of-logging/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2013/01/13/the-10-commandments-of-logging/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice write-up of going along to the recent Devopsdays New York Event. Focuses on the community rather than the topics. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the London event will have more of the big company and financial services folks mixed in with the startup crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://velohacker.com/2013/01/19/thoughts-on-devopsdays-nyc/&quot;&gt;http://velohacker.com/2013/01/19/thoughts-on-devopsdays-nyc/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever deployed your application to a PaaS without realising you have failing tests? Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple pre-deployment hook approach using a new feature on Azure. The example is using node.js but the pattern should be applicable to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codebetter.com/glennblock/2013/01/19/teach-your-website-new-deployment-tricks-with-azure-cli-1-of-xxx-running-mocha-tests/&quot;&gt;http://codebetter.com/glennblock/2013/01/19/teach-your-website-new-deployment-tricks-with-azure-cli-1-of-xxx-running-mocha-tests/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like the weekly email newsletter format and have an interest in the Hadoop ecosystem them the just launched Hadoop Weekly might be of interest. Good luck to the author with keeping it going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hadoopweekly.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hadoopweekly.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use any sort of log aggregation or searching tools then this survey is looking for your input. 5 minutes of questions on size, volume, backends and usage patterns. I&amp;rsquo;ll look out for the results when they are published too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/sematext.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNKUGVlSEw1RkdsWWZReExaVFhCeUE6MQ&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/a/sematext.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNKUGVlSEw1RkdsWWZReExaVFhCeUE6MQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well put argument that configuration belongs to the environments and not the application. A good before and after developer experience report of going from using Powershell and a hand rolled configuration management setup to using Puppet on another project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://uttamkini.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/configuration-belongs-to-the-environment-and-not-to-the-application/&quot;&gt;http://uttamkini.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/configuration-belongs-to-the-environment-and-not-to-the-application/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datadog is looking for a senior DevOps engineer to join the team. Datadog is a monitoring service that ingests and processes O(10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) metrics every day. If you enjoy operations on a large-scale, real-time platform, if you live and breathe AWS, Chef, Python, Cassandra and the likes, do apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jobs.datadoghq.com/apply/qyGWBC/Senior-DevOps-Engineer.html&quot;&gt;http://jobs.datadoghq.com/apply/qyGWBC/Senior-DevOps-Engineer.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QCon is back in London from the 4th to the 8th of March. Tutorials and lots of tracks, including several that should be of interest to readers of this newsletter. If you&amp;rsquo;re heading along you can use the code RUSH100 and save £100 off the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qconlondon.com/&quot;&gt;http://qconlondon.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10Gen have lots of Mongo related events coming up around the world and are on the lookout for speakers. Here&amp;rsquo;s a selection with more on the website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MongoDB London &amp;ndash; April 9 &amp;ndash; CFPs due Feb 22
MongoSF &amp;ndash; May 10 &amp;ndash; CFPs due March 8
MongoNYC &amp;ndash; June 20 &amp;ndash; CFPs due April 19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10gen.com/events&quot;&gt;http://www.10gen.com/events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Con is being held in Herzilya, in Israel, on the 28th of January. A good looking range of talks no continuous deployment, devops culture, configuration management, logging and some interesting looking case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopscon.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.devopscon.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cubism.js is a javascript plugin for visualising time series data. It looks ideal if you&amp;rsquo;re building dashboards based on Graphite or Cube. The demo is very pretty and the focus on usefulness and usability is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://square.github.com/cubism/&quot;&gt;http://square.github.com/cubism/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaurien is a different take on the chaos monkey. It&amp;rsquo;s a transparent TCP proxy that can be installed wherever you&amp;rsquo;re making connections. The magic comes in with behaviours, which can be triggered with code and do things like introduce a delay or increase the latency of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vaurien.readthedocs.org/&quot;&gt;http://vaurien.readthedocs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tatin is a light-weight in-memory HTTP state machine. It lets you store and retrieve volatile data using simple PUT and GET requests which might be useful for various orchestration tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/netmelody/tatin&quot;&gt;https://github.com/netmelody/tatin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orc is described as a Model driven orchestration framework for continuous deployment. It combines a git based CMDB with mcollective to ensure applications are at the correct version and active on the load balancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/youdevise/orc/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/youdevise/orc/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A (paid for) application for iPhone and soon Android, PilotSSH looks an interesting way of doing remote administration for common tasks. The GitHub repository of scripts is a neat idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pilotssh.com/&quot;&gt;http://pilotssh.com/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays is coming to London. And Austin. And Paris. And Berlin. And New York. And that&amp;rsquo;s just up until May. London and Austin are now open for registration and looking for talks and sponsors. If you&amp;rsquo;ve not yet made it to a devopsdays event (and even if you have) you really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss out: &lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now working for the UK Government I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly interested in the role of auditors and formal accreditation processes in devops. This blog post (and actually the entire blog) looks like a great resource. This post is discussing compensating controls for situations where developers should have access to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepragmaticauditor.com/?p=1220&quot;&gt;http://www.thepragmaticauditor.com/?p=1220&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good long discussion of the pros and cons of different testing workflows for configuration management. Focuses on Chef but it&amp;rsquo;s worth a read whatever tool you&amp;rsquo;re using. Includes an entire GitHub organisation of tools to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://erik.hollensbe.org/2012/12/21/chef-workflow/&quot;&gt;http://erik.hollensbe.org/2012/12/21/chef-workflow/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dashboards are an important part of monitoring systems and generally knowing what is happening within your system. This post makes the claim that many of these dashboards would be better represented as activity streams, and gives a few examples. I&amp;rsquo;d certainly like to see something like this for system monitoring data to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dashes.com/anil/2013/01/all-dashboards-should-be-feeds.html&quot;&gt;http://dashes.com/anil/2013/01/all-dashboards-should-be-feeds.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well reasoned blog post all about being on-call. How to organise on-call rotas, what it means to be on-call and more. Looks like the first post in a series too so hopefully more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.explain-it.org/wordpress/2013/01/03/on-pager-duty-a-reply/&quot;&gt;http://www.explain-it.org/wordpress/2013/01/03/on-pager-duty-a-reply/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A write-up of talking some scripts and lists for setting up a new OSX workstation and converting them to use Chef. Two posts this week about configuration management for developer workstations, good to see lots of people doing this and sharing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vanderveer.be/blog/2013/01/02/automating-the-setup-of-my-perfect-developer-environment-on-osx-10-dot-8-mountain-lion/&quot;&gt;http://vanderveer.be/blog/2013/01/02/automating-the-setup-of-my-perfect-developer-environment-on-osx-10-dot-8-mountain-lion/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part two of the series I mentioned last week on creating Chef Light Weight Resource Providers, this time focusing on the Resource side of things. Good starting documentation if you&amp;rsquo;re working with Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/01/07/creating-an-lwrp-part-2/&quot;&gt;http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/01/07/creating-an-lwrp-part-2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays is coming to London. 15th and 16th of March at Mary Ward House in the centre of London. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for talk proposals as well as sponsors, get in touch if you&amp;rsquo;re interested. Tickets are also on-sale with £40 off if you grab one of the early bird tickets still available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-london/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-london/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YSlow is a great browser plugin for measuring frontend web application performance. This project shows how to use YSlow in a headless mode, ideal for integration with continuous integration systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marcelduran/yslow/wiki/PhantomJS&quot;&gt;https://github.com/marcelduran/yslow/wiki/PhantomJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple chef-solo approach to configuring a developer workstation. Has simple configuration for Mint and OSX based systems and might be a good starting point if you&amp;rsquo;re not doing something similar yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 105 &amp;ndash; 7th January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little late this week as I&amp;rsquo;ve been travelling. A big thanks to all the people who spread the word about the delay on twitter and elsewhere. Back to our regular Sunday schedule next week all being well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news for Windows users on Amazon Web Services. Amazon have shipped a bit set of powershell tools with a console based interface for managing 20 of the AWS components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trainsignal.com/blog/amazon-launches-windows-powershell-support-for-aws&quot;&gt;http://www.trainsignal.com/blog/amazon-launches-windows-powershell-support-for-aws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week, another monkey from Netflix. This time it&amp;rsquo;s Janitor monkey, designed to tidy up and shut down unused EC2 instances and other AWS resources. Good for saving some money and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/01/janitor-monkey-keeping-cloud-tidy-and.html?m=1&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/01/janitor-monkey-keeping-cloud-tidy-and.html?m=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good productivity tips for interacting with MySQL at the command line. Clear explanations and examples of using pager, tee and edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2012/12/21/be-productive-with-the-mysql-command-line/&quot;&gt;http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2012/12/21/be-productive-with-the-mysql-command-line/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great article about why dry run modes for popular configuration management tools can lie to you. Examples in CFEngine, Puppet and Chef show how and why this can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/2012/12/21/promises-lies-and-dryrun-mode/&quot;&gt;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/2012/12/21/promises-lies-and-dryrun-mode/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagios has lots of well documented issues, one being scaling up the number of checks and the potential for long wait times between checks being rerun. This article covers an interesting approach using mcollecitve agents and a simple scheduler file to provide passive nagios checks with information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2013/01/01/scaling-nagios-nrpe-checks.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2013/01/01/scaling-nagios-nrpe-checks.php&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ripienaar/mnrpes&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ripienaar/mnrpes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article covering a methodology for analysing performance issues in distributed systems. USE, for utilization, saturation, and errors, provides some simple rules and things to measure to help find bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2413037&quot;&gt;http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2413037&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well reasoned post about why a traditional view of site availability is a little blunt. Good examples and arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2013/01/03/availability-nuance-as-a-service/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2013/01/03/availability-nuance-as-a-service/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light Weight Resources and Providers (LWRP) are an important concept in Chef, and this article (the first part of a series) goes into details about how to write the resource portion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dougireton.com/blog/2012/12/31/creating-an-lwrp/&quot;&gt;http://dougireton.com/blog/2012/12/31/creating-an-lwrp/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile 2013, being help in Nashville in August, has a Devops track and are on the lookout for talks. The deadline for submissions is set for February 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agile2013.agilealliance.org/speakers/&quot;&gt;http://agile2013.agilealliance.org/speakers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturnalia is billed as a time series database. It aims to offer high performance, compression, and advanced graphing and visualization features which sound well suited to various monitoring usecases.  It ships with a collectd based demo too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/0x0000/saturnalia&quot;&gt;https://bitbucket.org/0x0000/saturnalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 104 &amp;ndash; 30th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good few monitoring tools and utilities this week, plus a range of other interesting articles. Next weeks issue might be late as I&amp;rsquo;ll likely be travelling, don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t receive it on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A counter to the &amp;ldquo;no devops team&amp;rdquo; theme, describing the formation of a team to help an existing development and operations team work better together. Best quote &amp;ldquo;At first I was not sure it was the right name for this team, but now I don’t think it matters&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lumberjaph.net/devops/2012/12/16/about-devops.html&quot;&gt;http://lumberjaph.net/devops/2012/12/16/about-devops.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of interesting and detailed posts from the Indeed engineering team. Both describe the implementation of internal systems, first a log aggregation and next a highly available RPC framework. No code yet but the detailed discussion of the design choices is still interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.indeed.com/blog/2012/11/logrepo-enabling-data-driven-decisions/&quot;&gt;http://engineering.indeed.com/blog/2012/11/logrepo-enabling-data-driven-decisions/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.indeed.com/blog/2012/12/boxcar-self-balancing-distributed-services-protocol/&quot;&gt;http://engineering.indeed.com/blog/2012/12/boxcar-self-balancing-distributed-services-protocol/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etsy reduced the number of different technologies in use starting a couple of years ago. This post covers why they no-longer use Mongo, and how they used MySQL for the application instead. The focus is on the hidden work when using a new system or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mcfunley.com/why-mongodb-never-worked-out-at-etsy&quot;&gt;http://mcfunley.com/why-mongodb-never-worked-out-at-etsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good case study of a deployment pipeline for infrastructure components using Puppet. Nicely it covers a previous design and the problems with it, before documenting the final working system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/a-deployment-pipeline-for-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/a-deployment-pipeline-for-infrastructure/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another post about how devops fits into the skills and team structure within an organisation. The argument here is that devops, or developer operations, is likely to become a new specialism within larger teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://if.andonlyif.net/blog/2012/12/specializing-in-devops.html&quot;&gt;http://if.andonlyif.net/blog/2012/12/specializing-in-devops.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good list of best practices for speeding up software releases. Short descriptions that should be a good starting point for further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://manojanara.com/2012/12/26/8-best-practices-to-keep-the-release-train-moving/&quot;&gt;http://manojanara.com/2012/12/26/8-best-practices-to-keep-the-release-train-moving/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;logstash-tail is a nifty utility if you&amp;rsquo;re using logstash. With the addition of a tcp output to logstash, logstash-tail gives you a command line interface to tail filtered logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ohlol/logstash-tail&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ohlol/logstash-tail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good addition to the Erlang toolbox, folsomite aggregates folsom metrics from an Erlang process and exports them to either Riemann or Graphite. Good to see more folks using Riemann too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lefant.net/2012/08/11/folsomite/&quot;&gt;http://lefant.net/2012/08/11/folsomite/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/campanja/folsomite/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/campanja/folsomite/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphital is a ruby based tool for shipping system metrics to graphite. It is very easy to extend with scripts in any language, and includes a few sample plugins for common tools and low level metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rashidkpc/graphital&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rashidkpc/graphital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Riemann monitoring tool ships with a dashboard as an example of using the API but the tool can be used for different usecases. Riemann-grid is an alternative dashboard written in clojure that might be worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/exoscale/riemann-grid&quot;&gt;https://github.com/exoscale/riemann-grid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue marks the first issue with more than 5000 subscribers. that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people interested in a made-up word. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty impressive to see just how this community has grown over the last few years. Hopefully the following few links should keep everyone busy during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good blog post covering a more involved Vagrant workflow and helpfully showing a sample Vagrantfile making extensive use of Environment variables for configuration. The discussion of the problems in creating an appliance I think are going to be something lots of people hit next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/12/17/how-we-vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/12/17/how-we-vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice article about various software deployment patterns, using the example of Lego to encourage modularity and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awsadvent.tumblr.com/post/38592081115/exploring-aws-cli&quot;&gt;http://awsadvent.tumblr.com/post/38592081115/exploring-aws-cli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good argument for deploying regularly, taking the case of going to the dentist about as far as an analogy can be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefutureofdeployment.com/deploying-software-shouldnt-feel-like-visiting-the-dentist/&quot;&gt;http://thefutureofdeployment.com/deploying-software-shouldnt-feel-like-visiting-the-dentist/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logtash has been picking up speed of late and a big milestone in the relentless progress is coming in February with the release of the Logstash book. You can signup now to be emailed when it&amp;rsquo;s ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open source hosted continuous integration server Travis has just added support for uploading artifacts to S3 after builds. This should make a number of things possible, including various continuous deployment workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how Devops is influencing and making inroads into quite traditional IT organisations. This post has a few anecdotes and focuses on automation and it&amp;rsquo;s influence on change control heavy organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://servicevirtualization.com/profiles/blogs/adoption-of-devops-continues-to-accelerate&quot;&gt;http://servicevirtualization.com/profiles/blogs/adoption-of-devops-continues-to-accelerate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon have released a new, all-in-one, command line interface for all of AWS. Even better, within a day or release, AWS Advent have an article up on how to configure and use it. This should simplify working across different AWS services. Interestinly it&amp;rsquo;s written in Python this time, replacing the mix of Java and Ruby from the old tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/12/21/introducing-the-aws-command-line-interface/&quot;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/12/21/introducing-the-aws-command-line-interface/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting Vagrant setup, specifically for testing Puppet manifests and modules across multiple operating systems at the same time. Could do with more automation (probably a plugin or via the rake integration) but it looks a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/example42/vagrant-example42&quot;&gt;https://github.com/example42/vagrant-example42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scales is a reimagining of the Metrics library in Python. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite a port, but has a number of interesting features including timers, gauges, metrics aggregation and a built-in dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Cue/scales&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Cue/scales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giraffe is yet another Graphite dashboard, but one that is written in pure client side javascript. This makes deploying the dashboard incredibly easy, it&amp;rsquo;s just html, css, javascript and a few images. Configuration is well documented too and the demo is worth taking a look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kenhub/giraffe&quot;&gt;https://github.com/kenhub/giraffe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is commonly used to test out Chef cookbooks, but the cycle of creating, destroying and creating virtual machines can leave lots of stale data in your Chef server. Vagrant Butcher is a plugin for Vagrant that fixes this specific problem, removing the relevant data when the virtual machine is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 102 &amp;ndash; 16th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hopefully good mix of tutorials, opinions and new tools from the worlds of security, process and configuration management this week. All in a days work for people interested in the world of devops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of security advisories for all the software you&amp;rsquo;re running can be a time consuming chore so RiskDB looks an interesting project. It provides a good search based interface as as well free and paid accounts if you want some additional collaboration and integration features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://db.risk.io/&quot;&gt;https://db.risk.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with SQL then moving to using something like MongoDB can feel a little weird when writing non-trivial queries. This online application aims to help by converting SQL to Mongo queries, useful for learning the JSON based syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.querymongo.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.querymongo.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people have been documenting patterns, of both code and behaviour, for devops minded organisations. This post is hopefully the start of documenting some anti-patterns starting with Committed is “Done”, My Responsibility Ends Here and They should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-anti-patterns&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-anti-patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post aims to encourage more developers to embrace devops and makes a number of good points in doing so. From improving site reliability to building better software and improving your career prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How best to structure Puppet modules is something that&amp;rsquo;s really taken a step forward this last year, with tools starting to make assumptions about module structure beginning to emerge. This post documents much of the current best practice with a simple module example from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2012/12/13/simple-puppet-module-structure-redux.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2012/12/13/simple-puppet-module-structure-redux.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good writeup of taking an existing Chef cookbook and updating it to use the latest Test Kitchen. It&amp;rsquo;s a good walkthrough that should make a good guide if you&amp;rsquo;re updating one of your own cookbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/12/13/cookbook-integration-testing-with-real-examples/&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/12/13/cookbook-integration-testing-with-real-examples/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Box needs you to scale, harden and more-awesome-ify its multi-data-center, 1000s-of-hosts deployment system. We use good stuff like Scala and ZooKeeper to do it. Know the &amp;lsquo;right way&amp;rsquo; to deploy? Drop a line of interest directly to Box&amp;rsquo;s Director of Engineering Services: &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#104;&amp;#97;&amp;#109;&amp;#109;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x78;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#x2e;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x73;&amp;#111;&amp;#x68;&amp;#97;&amp;#109;&amp;#109;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x62;&amp;#111;&amp;#x78;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#46;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we&amp;rsquo;re also looking for ambitious Systems Engineers and Software Engineers who want to work on distributed systems. With over 10 million users and serving more than 92% of the Fortune 500, we&amp;rsquo;re also one of the hottest tech companies in Silicon Valley. Come help us get to the next level. We sponsor Visas too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LoadDays or Linux Open Administration Days is back next year on the 6th and 7th of April in Wilrijk, Belgium.  A call for proposals is open now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://loadays.org/&quot;&gt;http://loadays.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twemproxy is a fast and lightweight proxy for the memcached and redis protocols. It was primarily built to reduce the connection count on caching servers and is in use by Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest to name a few. The built int stats collection looks useful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy&quot;&gt;https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mctop is top for memcached, giving you a command line view of popular keys. The associated writeup demonstrates the types of problems mctop is aimed to solve as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/12/13/mctop-a-tool-for-analyzing-memcache-get-traffic/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/12/13/mctop-a-tool-for-analyzing-memcache-get-traffic/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/mctop/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/etsy/mctop/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMB appears to be a fully functional clone of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s SNS and SQS products. It makes use of Cassandra on the backend and aims to provide high availability and horizontal scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Comcast/cmb&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Comcast/cmb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metrics library is well used in Java environments and has many clones in other languages. However MetricCatcher takes the origin Metrics library and exposes it over a JSON based interface so it can be used easily from other languages and as a centralised service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 101 &amp;ndash; 9th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about December appears to be getting lots people writing interesting blog posts. As well as Sysadvent we also have AWSAdvent and lots of blog posts, tutorials and even a few screencasts and teaching videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another excellent advent calendar blog, this time focused on Amazon Web Services. We&amp;rsquo;re already 9 posts in but the following two in particular stood out, being the best description and documentation I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on both Cloudformation and the Virtual Private Cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awsadvent.tumblr.com/post/37167975262/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-amazon-virtual&quot;&gt;http://awsadvent.tumblr.com/post/37167975262/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-amazon-virtual&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://awsadvent.tumblr.com/post/37391299521/cloudformation-primer&quot;&gt;http://awsadvent.tumblr.com/post/37391299521/cloudformation-primer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zookeeper is one of those bits of software that lots of large organisations use but that can appear pretty impenetrable and heavyweight to everyone else. This article from the sysadvent calendar covers using Zookeeper for distributed coordination of a cluster of machines. Good high level description of Zookeeper and a nice relevant use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/day-4-zookeeper-for-distributed.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/day-4-zookeeper-for-distributed.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the second year of the Devops survey from Puppetlabs. A scattering of questions about what devops is and about what tools and practices people have been using this last year. The more people fill it in the better the overall results should be so if you have a spare few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://info.puppetlabs.com/devops-survey-2012.html&quot;&gt;http://info.puppetlabs.com/devops-survey-2012.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good content on scaling web applications can be hard to find, and harder to digest. This screencast, by Eric Lindvall of Papertrail, might be a good starting point for some. It&amp;rsquo;s $12 but aims to cover everything from system design, metrics, software selection and business implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peepcode.com/products/up-lindvall&quot;&gt;https://peepcode.com/products/up-lindvall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice presentation deck about the architectural choices at Etsy. Covers the software stack, metrics, rapid deployment and some of the challenges and ways of working around potential limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/kellan/architecting-for-change-qconnyc-2012&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/kellan/architecting-for-change-qconnyc-2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not included a what is devops post for a while but this post caught my eye. The main point it makes, with some good examples, is that devops really is about end to end business activities, not just developers and systems administrators working closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://klasson.tumblr.com/post/37205213856/thoughts-about-devops&quot;&gt;http://klasson.tumblr.com/post/37205213856/thoughts-about-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anemometer is an application from Box to help with optimizing mysql queries. It provides a very nice looking dashboard which provides tracking of query performance over time. This blog post covers a few tips as well as some general query profiling suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.blog.box.com/2012/12/optimizing-mysql-performance-at-scale-with-anemometer-2/&quot;&gt;http://tech.blog.box.com/2012/12/optimizing-mysql-performance-at-scale-with-anemometer-2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good lucking introduction to Chef, including both code samples, basic instructions and videos. Looks a place to find out about Chef if you&amp;rsquo;re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/12/06/learning-chef-part-1/&quot;&gt;http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/12/06/learning-chef-part-1/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insightful post mortem writeup from GitHub about networking issues that caused some downtime a week or so ago. A good example of a detailed writeup too, with the background, what happened and future planned improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1346-network-problems-last-friday&quot;&gt;https://github.com/blog/1346-network-problems-last-friday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7digital Ltd. is a leading digital media delivery company based in Shoreditch, London and operating globally. We’re small, fast, innovative and bursting at the seams with people passionate about music and technology. Half the organisation is made up of tech people (Devs, DBA, Systems etc) and our CEO is a geek. We’ve got good at delivering our products and services at a fast pace in an iterative manner, but the faster we move the more apparent it is we need to be able to change our infrastructure just as quickly and reliably. We need super-talented and enthusiastic Web Ops / Sys Admins who are keen to work in a highly collaborative manner to build a more robust, reliable and more highly automated platform which can cope with scaling up to meet the ever increasing demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://about.7digital.com/jobs/&quot;&gt;http://about.7digital.com/jobs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re heading to FOSDEM at the start of February and want to arrive a few days early you might be interested in a Puppetcamp event in Ghent on the Thursday and Friday. No schedule yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetcampghent2013.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;http://puppetcampghent2013.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roundtrip is an interesting looking monitoring tool aimed at tracking business events. It provides a very simple HTTP API at present with more interfaces on the way. The examples shown help with working out how you might make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 100 &amp;ndash; 2nd December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 issues down. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see that coming when I had the idea to write a newsletter. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting to have observed, experienced and participated in the growth of such a vibrant and interesting community around the word Devops. Hat tip to Patrick Debois for starting something huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sysadvent is back for another year, with two posts so far on easy visualisations using Google spreadsheets and then a nice writeup of some things from the devops community and how it might grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/day-01-easy-visualizations-with.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/day-01-easy-visualizations-with.html&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it along to the London Devops meetup this week and one of the presentations was all about scaling logstash. Lots of practical hints and tips in the slidedeck that should help you avoid some common and not-to-common pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/bobtfish/london-devops-logging-15433147&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/bobtfish/london-devops-logging-15433147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto, one of the creators of Vagrant, has launched a new company to support and extend Vagrant and to drive the development of the tool and ecosystem. More documentation and the much talked about support for multiple virtualisation backends are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great presentation analysing in great detail an AWS outage and concentrating nicely on how complex systems fail, and how failures can be avoided with a little help from W Edwards Deming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disqus, the comments as a service folks, recently moved to a more real time approach. Now they did it was interesting through, by writing an nginx module which allowed for long polling. They have open sourced the code as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Devops cafe podcast returns too this week, with an interesting discussion about Windows, Devops at Microsoft and the history of Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2012/11/27/devops-cafe-episode-36.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2012/11/27/devops-cafe-episode-36.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting set of blog posts, describing protocols or patterns for Devops adoption. The first two talk about the advantages of starting small and fixing a real problem quickly and about configuration management and limiting manual changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-protocols-start-small&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-protocols-start-small&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest is looking for a seasoned Operations Engineer to join our distributed team. Harvest is a popular time tracking application which has been around since 2006 and is used and loved by customers in over 100 countries. If you are skilled in Ruby, Chef, MySQL, Nginx, Git, Elasticsearch, cloud computing APIs and looking for an exciting new challenge, find out more info at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hrv.st/ops_engineer&quot;&gt;http://hrv.st/ops_engineer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing a MySQL master/slave setup can be a little tricky at times. One uncommon but fiddly operation is swapping the role of one of the machines in the cluster. This script does just that, along with lots of checking that everything has worked as intended. Worth reading even just as documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/37signals/mysql_role_swap/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/37signals/mysql_role_swap/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if Nginx was more an application server than a web server/proxy? Openresty aims to build just that, packaging nginx along with lots of 3rd party modules and dependencies. It lets you build applications using the Lua programming language and already supports backends for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Memcached, and Redis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openresty.org/&quot;&gt;http://openresty.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zabbix has a reputation for needing a lot of manual configuration. Recent improvements have made that more easily automatable and zcollective uses those new features to allow for building a host configuration using mcollective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scalefactory/zcollective&quot;&gt;https://github.com/scalefactory/zcollective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice looking big screen dashboard view for Nagios. As well as auto-refreshing content and having a high visibility design it allow for some limited interactivity for acknowledging problems, scheduling downtime and enabling/disabling notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lozzd/Nagdash&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lozzd/Nagdash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself documenting and running many Knife commands when using Chef then Spiceweasel might be the answer. It allows you to describe in JSON or YAML your Chef setup and then commands to convert that domain specific language to the relevant Knife commands.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 99 - 25th November 2012</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2012/11/25/99/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2012/11/25/99</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Issue 99 &amp;ndash; 25th November&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the very first (actually issue 0 which went unpublished) Devops Weekly just about 2 years ago, on the 21st of November 2010. I&amp;rsquo;m still not quite sure how I&amp;rsquo;ve kept it up for 99 issues but a big reason for that is all the people writing interesting content and telling others about this little newsletter. Thanks to everyone who has found it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice introduction to systems programming at Twitter and in particular how and why they use Scala extensively. Shows a few of the internal tools, including Zipkin which is open source and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before and Viz which I&amp;rsquo;ve not seen up until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://monkey.org/~marius/talks/twittersystems&quot;&gt;http://monkey.org/~marius/talks/twittersystems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article and the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the phrase configuration management schema used. People are sharing modules and cookbooks more often but I&amp;rsquo;ve not seen much sharing of how those are then put together, and thinking about that as a schema makes me wonder how that might work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zkybase.org/blog/2012/11/22/designing-configuration-management-schemas/&quot;&gt;http://zkybase.org/blog/2012/11/22/designing-configuration-management-schemas/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed slide deck with lots of code examples, showing how to make a local cloud using VirtualBox.  Lots of VBoxManage examples, a simple chef setup, how to use Doozer for configuration data. Worth flicking through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slidedecks.wilmoore.com/2012-confoo/diy-private-cloud-using-virtualBox-and-chef/#1&quot;&gt;http://slidedecks.wilmoore.com/2012-confoo/diy-private-cloud-using-virtualBox-and-chef/#1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good discussion of problems that come with different approaches to continuous delivery and deployment. The post argues for big picture thinking and standardisation, and points out some of the flaws with separating development completely from caring about the production infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://server.dzone.com/articles/fatal-impedance-mismatch&quot;&gt;http://server.dzone.com/articles/fatal-impedance-mismatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to attend the QCon conference in San Francisco a few weeks ago and just about all the slides from nearly 100 presentations over the three days. Lots to take a look at that should be of interest &amp;ndash; the Continuous Delivery track on thursday and many of the Architecture show and tell talks in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qconsf.com/sf2012/schedule/wednesday.jsp&quot;&gt;http://qconsf.com/sf2012/schedule/wednesday.jsp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataSift, the social data mining platform that helps organizations improve their understanding and use of Social Media, are looking for a talented Operations Engineer with a passion and flair for deploying and scaling web applications. Successful candidates will work in an enthusiastic team using tools such as Chef, Graphite and Hadoop. Find out more about our platform on High Availability &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/datasift_hs&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/datasift_hs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Packaging&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little separate section to group a few tools together this week all about system packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReproWeb is a nice looking repository browser for debian package repositories. It parses all the package metadata and presents a nice friendly user interface to browse the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baseblack/ReproWeb&quot;&gt;https://github.com/baseblack/ReproWeb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apt-Heroku is a simple example of how with a few shell scripts and Heroku you can have your own personal package repository online quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabiokung/apt-heroku&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fabiokung/apt-heroku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the above, here&amp;rsquo;s some code I&amp;rsquo;ve been using to build debian packages (using Vagrant and fpm), create a package repository using the dpkg toolchains and then also push that to Heroku or some other similar services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/garethr/packages&quot;&gt;https://github.com/garethr/packages&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.garethrushgrove.com/&quot;&gt;http://packages.garethrushgrove.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting whats going on with my system command line tool. Presents lots of information about CPU, disk, memory, network and running processes all in a nice, and responsive, console user interface. Cross platform too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nicolargo.github.com/glances/&quot;&gt;http://nicolargo.github.com/glances/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting Ruby tool to record the HTTP requests made during a test run. It stores them in a fixtures file and provides tools to allow you to play those requests back at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr&quot;&gt;https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 98 &amp;ndash; 18th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to FOSDEM (a big open source conference in Belgium) for a few years now, and will be back again next year. One of the highlights is the Configuration Management dev room and the call for proposals is open until the 15th of December. Any ideas for talks can be emailed to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#99;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#110;&amp;#x66;&amp;#x69;&amp;#103;&amp;#45;&amp;#109;&amp;#x67;&amp;#109;&amp;#x74;&amp;#45;&amp;#100;&amp;#x65;&amp;#118;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#111;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#x74;&amp;#115;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x66;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#115;&amp;#x64;&amp;#101;&amp;#109;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x72;&amp;#103;&amp;#x2e;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#x66;&amp;#x69;&amp;#103;&amp;#45;&amp;#109;&amp;#x67;&amp;#109;&amp;#116;&amp;#x2d;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x76;&amp;#114;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x69;&amp;#115;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x73;&amp;#46;&amp;#102;&amp;#111;&amp;#x73;&amp;#100;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#46;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#114;&amp;#x67;&amp;#46;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Weekly is sponsored by Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; launch cloud servers in multiple UK datacentres in seconds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More interesting discussion (and examples) around the best approach to making Chef cookbooks reusable. Getting a balance between concise domain specific code and generic, reusable recipes is hard so more posts like this are great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://realityforge.org/code/2012/11/12/reusable-cookbooks-revisited.html&quot;&gt;http://realityforge.org/code/2012/11/12/reusable-cookbooks-revisited.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice run down of open source load testing tools, including apachebench, httperf, jmeter and tsung. The tsung walkthrough, installation and configuration details in particular are of interest if you&amp;rsquo;ve not used tsung yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dak1n1.com/blog/14-http-load-generate&quot;&gt;http://dak1n1.com/blog/14-http-load-generate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing firewall rules is never really going to be fun. But this post covers a tool, ript, which aims to provide a nice DSL for maintaining iptables rules. The more interesting parts are in the workflow and the use of migrations in a similar way to a database schema migration tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/11/12/ript-quick-reliable-painless-firewalling/&quot;&gt;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/11/12/ript-quick-reliable-painless-firewalling/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A talk I gave a few months ago all about Infrastructure as Code. Pretty introductory stuff for most readers of this newsletter but hopefully a good starting point for anyone new to the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Infrastructure-as-Code&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Infrastructure-as-Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good post from Yammer about how they approached sharding a large Postgres database for a big Rails application. Useful for anyone with similar scaling problems as it nicely focuses on the database rather than the application requirements and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eng.yammer.com/sharding-a-large-rails-app/&quot;&gt;http://eng.yammer.com/sharding-a-large-rails-app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A talk from Ruby Conf a few weeks ago all about the state of ruby application monitoring from the folks at Librato. Discussion of the problem, some examples of solving it and some interesting bits about the monitoring primitives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1276-rubyconf2012-ruby-monitoring-state-of-the-union&quot;&gt;http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1276-rubyconf2012-ruby-monitoring-state-of-the-union&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix continue talking about and open sourcing the tools they build to maintain Netflix. Edda aims to make understanding how you&amp;rsquo;re using AWS easier, storing information from the API about instances, IPs, security groups, etc. and allowing you to query the changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/11/edda-learn-stories-of-your-cloud.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/11/edda-learn-stories-of-your-cloud.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone running java (or scala, clojure or jruby) commands from the command line probably knows about the slow startup time. Drip looks an interesting approach to fixing the problem, using a sprinkling of bash, C and Java. Lots of options and well documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flatland/drip&quot;&gt;https://github.com/flatland/drip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every week I include a graphite dashboard or plugin from Jason Dixon (@obfuscurity). This week it&amp;rsquo;s Therry. A simple services that provides a nice http end point for searching through Graphite metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 97 &amp;ndash; 11th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this weeks issue from San Francisco airport where it is currently about 5:30am. The upside to that is, between QCon and meeting up with nice folks from Heroku, LIbrato, Fastly, Twitter, Facebook, Travis and more, I&amp;rsquo;ve got loads of content, including more tool than I think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever included before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite QCon talks this week came from Chuck Rossi talking about release engineering at Facebook. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely link to the video when that&amp;rsquo;s available but in the meantime here&amp;rsquo;s a good writeup of some of the main point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2012/11/08/release-engineering-at-facebook/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2012/11/08/release-engineering-at-facebook/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good presentation from QCon this week all about the Netflix architecture. Lots of details and some new material focused on achieving high availability at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/architectures-for-high-availability-qconsf&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/architectures-for-high-availability-qconsf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you start to use Graphite more and more you might run into problems with having just one node. It turns out Graphite can be configured as a cluster and this post documents how. It also describes Graphite as &amp;ldquo;a nearly undocumented thing of sweetness&amp;rdquo; which entertained me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rcrowley.org/articles/federated-graphite.html&quot;&gt;http://rcrowley.org/articles/federated-graphite.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More good graphite content, this time about why histograms are useful and how to create them using statsd, at least after the referred pull request is merged and released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/histogram-statsd-graphing-over-time-with-graphite.html&quot;&gt;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/histogram-statsd-graphing-over-time-with-graphite.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to see folks using the Riemann monitoring tool in anger, and particularly interesting in this case to see it being used to collect information from a Windows and .NET environment. Several useful tools mentioned if you&amp;rsquo;re in a similar environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/2012/10/04/riemann-usage-at-bluemountain/&quot;&gt;http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/2012/10/04/riemann-usage-at-bluemountain/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting looking addition to the Rackspace cloud offering, the Rackspace Service Registry provides a nice, API driven, registry to make orchestration and other cluster management tasks easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rackspace.com/blog/keep-track-of-your-services-and-applications-with-the-new-rackspace-service-registry/&quot;&gt;http://www.rackspace.com/blog/keep-track-of-your-services-and-applications-with-the-new-rackspace-service-registry/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of great looking video from the recent Ricon conference from Basho. Loads of distributed systems talks plus monitoring, configuration management, Riak and more. Worth taking a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://basho.com/community/ricon2012/&quot;&gt;http://basho.com/community/ricon2012/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very impressive Postgres 9.2 realtime dashboard. I saw this at the Heroku offices earlier this week and it&amp;rsquo;s obvious how useful it could be for detecting and debugging issues. A live example is available too if you&amp;rsquo;re after a demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/will/datascope&quot;&gt;https://github.com/will/datascope&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascope.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;https://datascope.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very impressive looking distributed request tracing application. Allows for visualising the entire request lifecycle in a service based architecture. It does require you to be running ZooKeeper, Cassandra and Scribe however so it might be a little heavyweight for some use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.github.com/zipkin/&quot;&gt;http://twitter.github.com/zipkin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Puppet Dashboard is being taken over by the wider puppet community and finally seeing some activity. This fork looks encouraging, updating everything to Rails 3 and setting the scene for easier improvements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sodabrew/puppet-dashboard&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sodabrew/puppet-dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cube is a nifty looking time series collection and evaluation engine build on Mongo and Node.js. It has clients available in a number of languages and a few interesting tools, like a daily reporting engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/square/cube&quot;&gt;https://github.com/square/cube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple but powerful looking metrics collection daemon that can ship measurements to Graphite or Librato. Aims to address some failings in similar tools like munin, ganglia and collectd for this use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mk-fg/graphite-metrics&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mk-fg/graphite-metrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handy Jenkins plugin that sends build information to statsd and on to Graphite. Useful to get information about the number of builds and the time being taken for runs into graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joemiller/jenkins-statsd-plugin&quot;&gt;https://github.com/joemiller/jenkins-statsd-plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descartes is yet another Graphite dashboard but one with a different slant. Instead of real time information it&amp;rsquo;s aimed to collaboration, analysis and reviewing data sets after the fact. Would love to see a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/obfuscurity/descartes&quot;&gt;https://github.com/obfuscurity/descartes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 96 &amp;ndash; 4th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a note this week to say that the next issue of Devops Weekly may be delayed by a day or so. I&amp;rsquo;ll be in San Francisco all next week and I&amp;rsquo;m flying back most of Sunday. Normal service will resume the week after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes having large traditional organisations doing things in a modern way can help make it easier to make a case to your own management. This blog post (admittedly written by me) about how the UK Government are releasing several times a day hopefully makes a useful casestudy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/11/02/regular-releases-reduce-risk/&quot;&gt;http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/11/02/regular-releases-reduce-risk/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting, more personal, use of logstash for local IRC notifications. A good demonstration of the simple input, filter, output configuration model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unwiredcouch.com/2012/11/03/irc-notifications-with-logstash.html&quot;&gt;http://unwiredcouch.com/2012/11/03/irc-notifications-with-logstash.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially in the heat of the moment it can still feel quicker to make manual changes to get things working again. This post briefly touches on why this might not be the best idea and a few tips to make the path of least resistance based on simple automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/10/29/incentivising-automated-changes/&quot;&gt;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/10/29/incentivising-automated-changes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty epic debugging story involving ssh, tcpdump and nmap and more. Always nice to see someone write up all the context and technical details of one of those hard to debug problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mina.naguib.ca/blog/2012/10/22/the-little-ssh-that-sometimes-couldnt.html&quot;&gt;http://mina.naguib.ca/blog/2012/10/22/the-little-ssh-that-sometimes-couldnt.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memcached might be simple, but it does have a few more features than just setting and getting. This blog post mainly covers the Ruby API but demonstrates a few useful tricks which are worth knowing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/advanced-memcache&quot;&gt;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/advanced-memcache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good post about the tradeoffs inherent in database systems, but focusing not on CAP but on the cost of latency in normal running. Some worth reading comments too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/replication-and-latency-consistency.html&quot;&gt;http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/replication-and-latency-consistency.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tayu is a nice glue web service which integrates the Rundeck orchestration tool with PuppetDB. More evidence of the benefit of small tools and exposing programatic interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sirhopcount/tayu&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sirhopcount/tayu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uptime is an open source node.js and Mongo application which provides a nice remote uptime monitoring application, much like a self hosted (and single node) version of Pingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fzaninotto.github.com/uptime/&quot;&gt;http://fzaninotto.github.com/uptime/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bouncy is another interesting looking proxy framework which can be configured as a simple load balancer as well as a range of other more interesting tools. It supports websockets and ssl too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/substack/bouncy&quot;&gt;https://github.com/substack/bouncy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 95 &amp;ndash; 28th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes someone senior seems to be the topic of the week, with two well put posts that should give everyone something to consider and improve upon. It&amp;rsquo;s still conference season as well it seems with some good content from the Opscode community summit and AppSecUSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes someone senior? It&amp;rsquo;s quite common to see in job titles but this post tries to define what makes a system administrator senior, stressing it&amp;rsquo;s about being a multiplier for those around you much more than a hoarder of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/09/seniorsysadmins.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/09/seniorsysadmins.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neatly following from the above, this next post delves into what it means to be a senior engineer. This should be required reading for anyone working in the field and makes a fantastic list to work from when thinking about how you can improve your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Opscode community summit took place last week and the wiki is filled with notes from all the sessions. A huge range of content to wander through from ideas about the future of Chef to hints and tips and discussions of how people came to be involved in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+Community+Summit+2&quot;&gt;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+Community+Summit+2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great slidedeck from the security folks at Twitter about the approaches and tools they use. A focus on automation, workflows and some good looking examples of internally developed tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/xplodersuv/putting-your-robots-to-work-14901538&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/xplodersuv/putting-your-robots-to-work-14901538&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capistrano is a common deployment tool, but it&amp;rsquo;s quite possible as you get bigger for deploys to take longer and longer. This post starts with a deploy taking 10 minutes and shows debugging tricks and some optimisations which bring it back under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pagerduty.com/2012/10/growing-a-rails-application-how-we-made-deploy-fast-again/&quot;&gt;http://blog.pagerduty.com/2012/10/growing-a-rails-application-how-we-made-deploy-fast-again/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned Riemann a few times before, for those that haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting open source network and application monitoring tool that treats everything as a stream of data to be analysed. It&amp;rsquo;s creator has taken the bold move of deciding to work full time on Riemann and is looking for related work, people already using Riemann and more people to get involved in working on expanding the code and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aphyr.com/posts/255-the-future-of-riemann&quot;&gt;http://aphyr.com/posts/255-the-future-of-riemann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Server Bishop looks interesting. A way of visualising Puppet manifests and associated templates, and a quick one liner to download and execute the manifest in question. Sort of a fire and forget workflow for Puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://serverbishop.com/&quot;&gt;http://serverbishop.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://serverbishop.com/radu-spineanu/collectd-debian&quot;&gt;http://serverbishop.com/radu-spineanu/collectd-debian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice post making a strong case for the soft skills part of devops. Great examples and good tips for making healthy cross discipline communication a management priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-these-soft-parts&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-these-soft-parts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java environments tend to be a bit different to most unix setups, and that can make debugging and configuration harder. This post does a good job of explaining approaches to tuning the Java garbage collector. It provides some log file samples and a clear explanation of what you&amp;rsquo;re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.linkedin.com/26/tuning-java-garbage-collection-web-services&quot;&gt;http://engineering.linkedin.com/26/tuning-java-garbage-collection-web-services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good overview of a few recent security issues including TLS/SSL vulnerabilities, short keys for DKIM and more interestingly example cross-VM attacks in XEN virtualised environments. The later is worth keeping an eye on if you&amp;rsquo;re using public cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/attack-of-week-cross-vm-timing-attacks.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/attack-of-week-cross-vm-timing-attacks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good post making the point that although automation is powerful, it&amp;rsquo;s also not always the right approach. And that importantly devops really is more about culture and communication than jumping straight to automating all the things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newtoniannuggets.com/2012/10/25/can-you-do-devops-without-automation/&quot;&gt;http://newtoniannuggets.com/2012/10/25/can-you-do-devops-without-automation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance testing in production can be a tricky affair, Kage attempts to make that easier. It can shadow the traffic passing through it to a second set of servers, allowing you to test pre-production code under real world load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cookpad/kage&quot;&gt;https://github.com/cookpad/kage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neat idea for a service to check on the running of periodic tasks. Simply ping the service in your scripts and you get an overview of when things last ran plus an email if the script appears not to run in the expected period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deadmanssnitch.com/&quot;&gt;https://deadmanssnitch.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nifty tool for managing and sharing complex ssh configs. It defines a very simple DSL which makes defining tunnels and ssh options easy, and a command line tool to convert that to a working ssh config file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aelse/dot-ssh-config&quot;&gt;https://github.com/aelse/dot-ssh-config&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 94 &amp;ndash; 21st October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of good blog posts and reading materials this week rather than tools, videos and presentations. In particular the Ops School systems administration syllabus deserves a special mention. I&amp;rsquo;d bet nearly all the readers of this newsletter would benefit from reading through it &amp;ndash; and if not then, if you have the time, you could be contributing back. Good work all the folks behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal education and System Administration aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly the best of friends. So this new site is most welcome. It already contains a huge amount of count, structured as a syllabus for learning systems  administration based on some basic Linux knowledge. Networking, Security, File systems, Datacentres, Virtualisation and more. It&amp;rsquo;s all on GitHub as well if you have time to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ops-school.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;http://ops-school.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opsschool/curriculum&quot;&gt;https://github.com/opsschool/curriculum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a devops team isn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea. But as more people have become interested in this devops thing it&amp;rsquo;s not always clear why &amp;ndash; especially without talking face to face with people already doing it. This post discusses why an extra team is the exact opposite of the culture of collaboration that devops is trying to encourage. Required reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/&quot;&gt;http://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice writeup of one persons experience with Chef over the last year. It contains lots of tips for anyone just getting started plus some hard learned recommendations. Lots relevant to tools other than Chef too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/a-year-with-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/a-year-with-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in environments using configuration management tools SSH still has a place, and understanding the power of the SSH configuration file can make this much easier, especially in team environments. This post covers the basics plus expands a little on using tunnels to connect to externally closed ports via SSH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nerderati.com/2011/03/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/&quot;&gt;http://nerderati.com/2011/03/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more SSH tricks and a more, for solving a common problem; just how identical are your staging and production environments? This post discusses an approach were they are virtually identical, down to the network addressing. This poses a few usability problems which the post discusses solutions to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/10/14/environment-agnostic-machines-and-applications/&quot;&gt;http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/10/14/environment-agnostic-machines-and-applications/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a new post but I found myself doing quite a bit of load testing and analysis recently and this blog post is worth reading on the subject. It covers lots of common misunderstandings and has a number of good tips for getting useful results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/05/18/http_benchmark_rules&quot;&gt;http://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/05/18/http_benchmark_rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few weeks go by without me finding something else cool in the Nginx documentation. But Nginx doesn&amp;rsquo;t do everything, including have good support the HTTP Vary header. But Nginx can be extended using the Lua module, and this post shows how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jimpurbrick.com/2012/10/14/adding-vary-header-support-nginx/&quot;&gt;http://jimpurbrick.com/2012/10/14/adding-vary-header-support-nginx/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing the Waza conference from Heroku last year and wishing I&amp;rsquo;d been able to make it. Well, all the videos are now available online, including quite a few that might be interested to readers here. The Logs as Conversations and Sane Dependency Management talks in particular sounds really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/groups/waza2012&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/groups/waza2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuration management code can often appear quite different to other forms of programming. This presentation does a good job of drawing lots of parallels, from the primitive building blocks of Chef and Puppet up to
tooling, profilers and testing approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/code-but-not-as-we-know-it-infrastructure-as-code&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/code-but-not-as-we-know-it-infrastructure-as-code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting approach to testing configuration and setup of a machine. It&amp;rsquo;s a shell script based tool which tests from the point of view of a black box, making it useful whatever language or framework you might be using. A supporting blog post showing more examples would be handy though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vimeo/simple-black-box&quot;&gt;https://github.com/vimeo/simple-black-box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMfest uses Pallet to control Virtualbox instances, giving you a very nice repl to create, query and destroy local instances. You can also define boxes in code much like you can with Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 93 &amp;ndash; 14th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little short of content this week as I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather unreasonably busy. More content from some recent excellent conferences plus a particularly good post all about designing for failure in order to build robust systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 67 videos from the recent PuppetConf are available for viewing. That&amp;rsquo;s probably about two continuous days worth of material. Lots of Puppet specific content but also lots of sessions that should be more broadly applicable too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/watch-and-learn-puppetconf-2012-videos/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/watch-and-learn-puppetconf-2012-videos/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice presentation from devopsdays Rome all about different approaches to building a pipeline. It&amp;rsquo;s missing some context without the presenter but the diagrams generally do a good job of at least suggesting approaches to documenting a continuous delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/duality72/beyond-continuous-delivery-at-devopsdays-rome-2012&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/duality72/beyond-continuous-delivery-at-devopsdays-rome-2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the tools we&amp;rsquo;re using mature we need better educational materials both for new starters and experts. So it&amp;rsquo;s good to see folks like Peepcode coming out with a new two part screencast series on Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peepcode.com/products/chef-i&quot;&gt;https://peepcode.com/products/chef-i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building resilient systems is all about managing inevitable failures. This post picks out a few real world problems and some of the things that have worked well for National Instruments in detecting and preventing failures affecting customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/11/14/devops-tip-design-for-failure/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/11/14/devops-tip-design-for-failure/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup of an interview with John Alspaw from Etsy. The post picks out a few take away points around what devops means for the structure of teams, building up slowly to lots of deployments a day and approaches to database schema migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rhebus.posterous.com/interview-with-john-allspaw-on-continuous-del&quot;&gt;http://rhebus.posterous.com/interview-with-john-allspaw-on-continuous-del&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java environments work just differently enough to say Ruby or Python to mean shared tooling isn&amp;rsquo;t that common. This talk is both a good introduction to Puppet and, at the end, a great demonstration of why a Java development team should care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/carlossg/puppet-for-java-developers-javazone-no-2012&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/carlossg/puppet-for-java-developers-javazone-no-2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLOSS UK are hosting an unconference in London, 9am to 5pm Saturday 27th October. It should be a good opportunity to learn new things or to show off what you&amp;rsquo;ve been working on if you have the day spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flossuk.org/Events/Unconference2012&quot;&gt;http://www.flossuk.org/Events/Unconference2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loom is another tool to make bootstrapping puppet machines easier. It makes use of Fabric to do the remote execution and librarian-puppet for manage module dependencies. Might be worth a look if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in different puppet workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bfirsh/loom&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bfirsh/loom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experimental webhook server for use with GitHub. It waits for updates to your chef repository and then synchronises the code on your Chef server. You could probably build some quite nice pipeline deployment mechanisms with this I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adamhjk/chef-github-hook&quot;&gt;https://github.com/adamhjk/chef-github-hook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 92 &amp;ndash; 7th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slide deck heavy issue this week with lots of Velocity and DevopsDays content, with I&amp;rsquo;m sure much more to find over the next few weeks if I get the chance. I&amp;rsquo;ve also just realised the content this week has a bit of a UK theme, with talks and events from London and tools and posts from Brits on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A Note from your Curator&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be visiting San Francisco in November to speak at the excellent QCon conference. I&amp;rsquo;ll be around all week from the 5th so if anyone has any recommendations for things to do or wants to meet up let me know. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the conference you can register with the code &amp;ldquo;rush100&amp;rdquo; and get an extra $100 off the price too :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qconsf.com/&quot;&gt;http://qconsf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal service resumes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Velocity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few days this week at the excellent Velocity conference in London. Lots of great talks, demos and discussions. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few of the posts and slide decks I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference website has already published some slides and videos from the conference, mainly of the keynote sessions from the morning slots. The talks from Chris Brown (Opscode) and Girish Patangay (Facebook) in particular are worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2012/public/schedule/proceedings&quot;&gt;http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2012/public/schedule/proceedings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides from one of the tutorials entitled Escalating Scenarios: Outage Handling Pitfalls. It makes the case that you are definitely going to have failures in production and provides lots of tips for how to deal with them when  (and before) they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/velocity-eu-2012-escalating-scenarios-outage-handling-pitfalls&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/velocity-eu-2012-escalating-scenarios-outage-handling-pitfalls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one of the tutorials, this time focusing on the importance of monitoring to complex application architectures. It stresses the importance of being able to observe the system at work, without which you won&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to react to failures quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/postwait/monitoring-and-observability&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/postwait/monitoring-and-observability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great talk from the folk at Etsy about the progression from 2007 to now in terms of size and culture. It goes year by year through the evolution of the organisation, showing just how much effort went in to create the right environment for all the tools that came later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mcdonnps/continuously-deploying-culture-scaling-culture-at-etsy-14588485&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/mcdonnps/continuously-deploying-culture-scaling-culture-at-etsy-14588485&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions of how much automation is sensible kicked off a few good posts, this one reveals some nifty Puppet patterns for making configuration variables immutable, for cases when changing them is much better done by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dan.carley.co/blog/2012/10/01/unautomating-with-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://dan.carley.co/blog/2012/10/01/unautomating-with-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caching is an interesting topic, and important to have a clear plan in place if you want to use it without lots of puzzling debugging sessions. This blog post proposes some interesting approaches to application architecture for web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://martin.kleppmann.com/2012/10/01/rethinking-caching-in-web-apps.html&quot;&gt;http://martin.kleppmann.com/2012/10/01/rethinking-caching-in-web-apps.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook have talked before about how they run the operations side of the site, and this article has a few interesting bits and pieces about the details. Lots of familiar topics from metrics to a culture of shared ownership and the need for everyone to be involved in operating the software applications they build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gigaom.com/cloud/how-facebook-solves-the-it-culture-wars-and-scales-its-site/&quot;&gt;http://gigaom.com/cloud/how-facebook-solves-the-it-culture-wars-and-scales-its-site/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still gutted I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make DevopsDays this week, if only because I missed this talk. It&amp;rsquo;s a great overview of the current state of open source monitoring. It kicks off with a dive into terminology, touches on lots of interesting topics (metrics as first class business data), lists the good and bad of open source tools and tries to paint a picture of a composable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/u/obfuscurity/p/the-state-of-open-source-monitoring&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/u/obfuscurity/p/the-state-of-open-source-monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An event all about continuous integrations and deployment pipelines in London later this month. It&amp;rsquo;s free to register and being held on the 25th of October in the Mozilla offices near Covent Garden from 6:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://accu-london-continuous-delivery.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;https://accu-london-continuous-delivery.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building frameworks around conventions is something of a specialty for 37 Signals. They have just released the tools they use to make the 37 command line tool chain and it provides a nice way of grouping ad-hoc scripts with the bonus of autocompletion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3264-automating-with-convention-introducing-sub&quot;&gt;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3264-automating-with-convention-introducing-sub&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/37signals/sub&quot;&gt;https://github.com/37signals/sub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FITB automatically polls every port on a list of switches you give it and generates handy RRD graphs. Great for very quickly getting at network IO and discovering what all your ports are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lozzd/FITB&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lozzd/FITB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pencil is another tool for building dashboards from data in Graphite. Once pointed at your Graphite install you can configure dashboards and graphs in YAML. It would be nice to see a screen shot in the readme but it might be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 91 &amp;ndash; 30th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of PuppetConf related content this week, although lots of it should hopefully be relevant even if you&amp;rsquo;re not using the Puppet tools. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be at Velocity in London this coming week, and with that and devopsdays in Rome hopefully next weeks issue will be similarly packed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PuppetConf&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed out on PuppetConf this year but from all the reports it sounds like it was even better than last year. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few of the links I&amp;rsquo;ve found already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally don&amp;rsquo;t link to the homepage of sites, preferring to stick with individual articles. But I&amp;rsquo;m making an exception for Kent Bye who has written up 12 of the talks from the conference in quite a bit of detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kentbye.com/&quot;&gt;http://kentbye.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinterest make extensive use of Puppet and have written a nice API wrapper for querying stored configuration data. The repo contains the presentation along with the API server and some examples using it to, for instance, generate host files for EC2 instances based on data from Puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pinterest/puppetconf&quot;&gt;https://github.com/pinterest/puppetconf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making modular, reusable and configurable puppet modules takes a good bit of thinking about. This presentation delves into some of the guidelines used for the Lab 42 module set and shows lots of examples and suggested approaches to problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/Alvagante/puppet-modules-for-fun-and-profit&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/Alvagante/puppet-modules-for-fun-and-profit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good post looking to document some patterns for building scalable systems, based on experience from Yahoo and Digg. It introduces caching, load balancing and off line processing  and makes a good point about most computer science programs not covering practical material like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lethain.com/introduction-to-architecting-systems-for-scale/&quot;&gt;http://lethain.com/introduction-to-architecting-systems-for-scale/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging complex systems is something of an art, so public post mortems are a great way of learning without experiencing the error yourself. Travis CI are being incredibly open about the running of the service and this tale of timeouts is worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2012-09-24-post-mortem-pull-request-unavailability/&quot;&gt;http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2012-09-24-post-mortem-pull-request-unavailability/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of alerting on collected metrics and this example, using Ganglia and Nagios, shows how to monitor a hardware RAID controller. The principles though are applicable to anything you can script the extraction of information from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.vuksan.com/2012/09/28/monitoring-health-of-delllsi-raid-arrays-with-ganglia/&quot;&gt;http://blog.vuksan.com/2012/09/28/monitoring-health-of-delllsi-raid-arrays-with-ganglia/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL is hugely powerful and those that use it tend to be quite evangelical about its advantages. This slidedeck runs through lots of the powerful features found in the database, including the wide range of extensions and datatypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/u/craigkerstiens/p/postgres-demystified&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/u/craigkerstiens/p/postgres-demystified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sshuttle looks an interesting tool for when setting up a VPN is too much work. It&amp;rsquo;s a transparent proxy server that works as a poor man&amp;rsquo;s VPN. It forwards everything over ssh and also supports DNS tunnelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;language-puppet is an attempt to reimplement much of Puppet in Haskel, aiming to provide improved speed and memory usage. It can be used to parse .pp files, compile and interpret them, evaluate the templates and already integrates with PuppetDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lpuppet.banquise.net/&quot;&gt;http://lpuppet.banquise.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-puppet&quot;&gt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-puppet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NetFlix ChaosMoney works on EC2 but has inspired a number of similar tools, including WazMonkey which aims to do the same sort of thing for Azure. At the moment running WazMonkey chooses a role instance from your service at random and reboots it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.smarx.com/posts/wazmonkey-chaos-monkey-for-windows-azure&quot;&gt;http://blog.smarx.com/posts/wazmonkey-chaos-monkey-for-windows-azure&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smarx/WazMonkey&quot;&gt;https://github.com/smarx/WazMonkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;puppet-autoami is a tool that uses puppet to create Amazon Machine Images for use on EC2. It uses a database to store information about your images, and makes clever use of a report processor to determine when to create new AMIs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 90 &amp;ndash; 23rd September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of posts on automation, configuration management, upcoming events and some interesting looking tools this week. A few weeks of solid devops flavoured events kicks off this week too with PuppetConf and Surge Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epic part one of a series of blog posts on the role of automation in mature engineering teams. Automation is hugely powerful, and generally seen as exclusively a good thing. However automation is only truly useful if it&amp;rsquo;s trustable. Lots of other good ideas in here to think about too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/09/21/a-mature-role-for-automation-part-i/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/09/21/a-mature-role-for-automation-part-i/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s PupperConf this coming week on the 27th and 28th, and PuppetLabs are streaming lots of the talks for those that can&amp;rsquo;t make it. You can signup to receive the details now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://info.puppetlabs.com/puppetconf2012-live.html&quot;&gt;http://info.puppetlabs.com/puppetconf2012-live.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started with monitoring can be a little overwhelming due to all the different moving parts. This post aims to make setting up some simple monitoring quick and easy, and in my experience once you&amp;rsquo;re over that first hump it&amp;rsquo;s easy to carry on investigating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unwiredcouch.com/2012/09/15/getting-started-with-monitoring.html&quot;&gt;http://unwiredcouch.com/2012/09/15/getting-started-with-monitoring.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few interesting examples of Node.js adoption in large organisation, and an argument that it will become more and more common. Some counter arguments about the Javascript language blocking some of this, but it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.appfog.com/node-js-is-taking-over-the-enterprise-whether-you-like-it-or-not/&quot;&gt;http://blog.appfog.com/node-js-is-taking-over-the-enterprise-whether-you-like-it-or-not/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another episode of the Food Fight podcast, this time with an interview with Patrick Debois and Mitchell Hashimoto and lots of discussions about the future of Vagrant, including future integrations with OpenStack, KVM and EC2. This makes lots of sense, as it&amp;rsquo;s the vagrant workflow that&amp;rsquo;s the important part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foodfightshow.org/2012/09/vagrant.html&quot;&gt;http://foodfightshow.org/2012/09/vagrant.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in Sensu for a while, but still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to experimenting with it. This post should make that easier, showing how to bring up Sensu on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unwiredcouch.com/2012/07/31/deploy-sensu-heroku.html&quot;&gt;http://unwiredcouch.com/2012/07/31/deploy-sensu-heroku.html&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good post all about the concept of GameDays, exercises to test emergency response. The post is a great discussion between people from Etsy, Opscode and Google about why it&amp;rsquo;s important to do this for real and how best to try and arrange GameDays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371297&quot;&gt;http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371297&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how this might be useful, but it&amp;rsquo;s very neat. It&amp;rsquo;s an HTTP server written in bash. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in better understanding netcat or learning a bit more bash from a well documented and commented script then it might be worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/avleen/bashttpd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/avleen/bashttpd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orchestration is still a complex topic, and tools are a good way of discussing the problems people feel exist. Mastermind is a new Ruby based tool which lets you create definitions of types of work and define jobs that run those definitions, all using an internal DSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danryan/mastermind&quot;&gt;https://github.com/danryan/mastermind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foodcritic lint tool for Chef has a very nice pluggable architecture, allowing you to define you&amp;rsquo;re own rules. Etsy have published the rules they use and they worth looking at. Warning about exec resources using wget, curl and git for instance are out, as it restarting core services from recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/foodcritic-rules/blob/master/rules.rb&quot;&gt;https://github.com/etsy/foodcritic-rules/blob/master/rules.rb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 89 &amp;ndash; 16th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to see the debate around Devops turning to what it means for organisations, on top of what it means for individuals. In large organisations in particular, with existing structures and defined job roles, the changes required make for an interesting topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good article drawing on personal experience of the transition to a devops way of working. The focus is on the making technical and cultural changes in small chunks over time, it&amp;rsquo;s not all about a single change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/articles/wide-range-devops&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/articles/wide-range-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article about what devops does to existing roles in large organisations. Makes some good points and goes into detail about release engineers, developers and operations. I&amp;rsquo;d have liked to have seen product management on that list too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/devops/entry/who_moved_my_cheese_an_exploration_of_the_effect_devops_has_on_roles_in_the_enterprise2?lang=en&quot;&gt;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/devops/entry/who_moved_my_cheese_an_exploration_of_the_effect_devops_has_on_roles_in_the_enterprise2?lang=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL and MySQL discussions tend to end badly. This huge post tries to explain why, and goes into lots of technical details about what makes MySQL and PostgreSQL so different and suited to different usecases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/or-modelling-interlude-postgresql-vs.html&quot;&gt;http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/or-modelling-interlude-postgresql-vs.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post covers how to setup a simple development environment, but on a Linux system console. This is mainly just good fun (I think), but it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting way to think about power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://klaig.blogspot.be/2012/09/setup-fancy-development-environment-on.html&quot;&gt;http://klaig.blogspot.be/2012/09/setup-fancy-development-environment-on.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to other disciplines for insights into web operations always makes for an interesting blog post or talk. This one looks at stress-strain curves and some mechanical engineering approaches, and swaps bars of metal for CPU or disk usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/09/10/fundamental-stress-strain-curves-in-web-engineering/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/09/10/fundamental-stress-strain-curves-in-web-engineering/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evernote operate a sharded architecture, and this post covers how they bring up new physical machines as they add new customers. As well as using Puppet they make extensive use of Debian preseed, and show example preeseed files that might be useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google stores a lot of information. Spanner is Google&amp;rsquo;s scalable, multi-version, globally-distributed, and synchronously-replicated database. Originally written for the advertising backend, this paper goes into the details of why they built it and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A virtual event this week, Hangops is a weekly gathering aimed at remote workers. Every friday various folks ops and dev jump onto a Google Hangout for a chat about a suggested topic. It&amp;rsquo;s at 2PM Pacific time so best suited to US readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hangops.com/&quot;&gt;http://hangops.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woodchuck is another log shipper for logstash. It&amp;rsquo;s Ruby based and currently supports file inputs and stdout and redis outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mission Control Technologies is a real-time monitoring and visualization platform. But from Nasa. It provides an API, a pluggable architecture and cimes with a Java based graphical interface for composing dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 88 &amp;ndash; 9th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of upcoming events new this week, and with Velocity, Surge, Puppet Conf, Devops Days and more in the next month or so we should have lots of interesting write-ups, videos and slide decks coming up soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Olympics is nearly over, and the BBC have published a thoroughly interesting article and sets of architecture diagrams about how they dealt with the rather large software requirements. Everything from meta data, video streaming, caching and more. The big diagram alone with worth spending some time looking over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/08/building_olympic_website.html&quot;&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/08/building_olympic_website.html&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice post from the GitHub folks on how they monitor the performance of the application. Lots and lots of custom dashboards that should act as inspiration for anyone doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1252-how-we-keep-github-fast&quot;&gt;https://github.com/blog/1252-how-we-keep-github-fast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good article introducing configuration management to developers published in the IEEE Software. Good points about the growing complexity of software requiring more involvement in infrastructure from developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20120904/&quot;&gt;http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20120904/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware is often ignored in all the software talk, especially as lots of traditional hardware activities are increasingly being abstracted in software. But their is still a place for hardware talk and both 37 Signals and Etsy have published interesting articles in the week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3202-behind-the-scenes-the-hardware-that-powers-basecamp-campfire-and-highrise&quot;&gt;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3202-behind-the-scenes-the-hardware-that-powers-basecamp-campfire-and-highrise&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has logs but how often people use them probably varies hugely. This article covers some of the uses you might put your logs and different techniques for getting value out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.logentries.com/2012/05/how-often-should-you-look-at-your-event-and-system-logs-daily-weekly-or-just-when-there-is-a-problem/&quot;&gt;https://blog.logentries.com/2012/05/how-often-should-you-look-at-your-event-and-system-logs-daily-weekly-or-just-when-there-is-a-problem/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ScaleCamp, the one-day unconference for and by people who care about web performance and scalability is back, held the day after the Velocity conference this year in London on the 5th of October. Tickets are available from 5pm UK time today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scalecamp.org.uk/&quot;&gt;http://www.scalecamp.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://scalecamp2012.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;http://scalecamp2012.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM, the huge open source conference held in Belgium each year has a call for dev rooms out, closing on the 1st of October. They are looking for any ideas that for rooms filled with presentations, brainstorming and hacking sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2013/call_for_devrooms.html&quot;&gt;https://fosdem.org/2013/call_for_devrooms.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 28th and 29th next year will see the first Monitorama conference in Boston, MA. Registration isn&amp;rsquo;t open yet but the schedule already looks amazing &amp;ndash; definitely one to keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://monitorama.com/&quot;&gt;http://monitorama.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fancy looking event tracking and graphing tool built on eventmachine and redis. Lots of sample configurations provided that should make getting started easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric&quot;&gt;https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astor is an interesting looking alternative to Graphite and Statsd. It provides a simple HTTP based API, a ZeroMQ interface and installation instructions for getting setup on EC2 quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 87 &amp;ndash; 2nd September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked this morning and this newsletter now has 4000 subscribers. That&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of people interested in the same topic, especially one some folks complain that no-one can provide a good definition for. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing more content too from meetups and user groups, which again suggests a real growing community &amp;ndash; a big thank you to everyone involved in spreading the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announced at this years Chef Summit, Opscode has started releasing the new erlang based Chef server components. At the moment this is a series of individual components, but the built tools and packaged release should be available soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/08/27/introducing-erchef/&quot;&gt;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/08/27/introducing-erchef/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a few people starting to investigate BOSH. This screencast looks like a good starting point, and the bosh-solo tool described looks an excellent workflow addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drnicwilliams.com/2012/08/20/creating-new-bosh-releases-with-bosh-gen-and-bosh-solo/&quot;&gt;http://drnicwilliams.com/2012/08/20/creating-new-bosh-releases-with-bosh-gen-and-bosh-solo/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/drnic/bosh-solo&quot;&gt;https://github.com/drnic/bosh-solo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in any of the features of SmartOS then this video from the BayLISA meetup is worth checking it. It&amp;rsquo;s 40 minutes long and covers may of the interesting SmartOS features of interesting to systems administrators including KVM, zones and ZFS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://smartos.org/2012/08/22/smartos-an-sa-primer/&quot;&gt;http://smartos.org/2012/08/22/smartos-an-sa-primer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks a good site to keep an eye on. Operations Anti-Patterns is documenting real world case studies of interesting failures everyone can learn from. So far it contains a few articles on migrating DNS and on the perils of restricted access to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opsantipatterns.com/&quot;&gt;http://opsantipatterns.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are working on workflow tooling around the configuration management stack. This example introduces a git hook based mechanism for deploying puppet code to remote servers. It also features some validation of manifests to prevent pushing out invalid code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com/blog/2012/08/29/puppet-git-receiver/&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com/blog/2012/08/29/puppet-git-receiver/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripe have been running a capture the flag game for a little while. This article delves into some of the configuration and setup they did when building up the architecture. Everything from performance problems creating users to chroot, permissions and some FCGI hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gregbrockman.com/2012/08/system-design-stripe-capture-the-flag/&quot;&gt;https://blog.gregbrockman.com/2012/08/system-design-stripe-capture-the-flag/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your ops people are as much of a human resource as they are technical ones&amp;rdquo;. A good opinion piece of the rapid changes to the world of systems administration and Devops, with a large focus on the people involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://erik.hollensbe.org/2012/08/31/your-ops-team-is-probably-important/&quot;&gt;http://erik.hollensbe.org/2012/08/31/your-ops-team-is-probably-important/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Devops community if filled with people learning more about development or more about systems administration (or more about both). Introductory articles like this 10 things every sysadmin should know are useful both for people new to the field, whether experienced developers or brand new operations folk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletesting.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/10-things-to-know-when-starting-out-as.html&quot;&gt;http://agiletesting.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/10-things-to-know-when-starting-out-as.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re working with personal data then realistic sample data sets can be a pain to put together. Data::Anonymization is a nice looking ruby tool used to anonymize existing data. The documentation covers lots of different approaches for different problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunitparekh.github.com/data-anonymization/&quot;&gt;http://sunitparekh.github.com/data-anonymization/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making Vagrant base boxes is surprisingly easy to do, even just using the raw VBoxManage commands. Here&amp;rsquo;s a example for building up-to-date Centos boxes if you want to be on the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 86 &amp;ndash; 26th August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few links this week to other Devops flavoured publications; namely the Food Fight podcast and the newer ShipShow podcast. I think it&amp;rsquo;s great for the community that we have lots of places you can go to discover new things. Good job all those involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ship Show is a twice-monthly podcast, featuring discussion on everything from build engineering to devops and release management. Only a few episodes so far but worth catching up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theshipshow.com/&quot;&gt;http://theshipshow.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More podcasts, this time the frequently mentioned Food Fight. This episode has a chat with Jesse Newland all about the Github infrastructure and in particular how it&amp;rsquo;s managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foodfightshow.org/2012/08/chatops-at-github-with-jesse-newland.html&quot;&gt;http://foodfightshow.org/2012/08/chatops-at-github-with-jesse-newland.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is no longer quite as tied to VirtualBox after this merge. At the moment that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it has support for another virtualisation stack, but it&amp;rsquo;s a big step towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/commit/391dc392675c73518ebf04252d824fe916e8860b&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/commit/391dc392675c73518ebf04252d824fe916e8860b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few tips for adding statsd powered instrumentation to a typical Rails application. Shows a few different approaches, including using middleware, class overloading and using hooks provided by Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikeperham.com/2012/08/25/using-statsd-with-rails/&quot;&gt;http://www.mikeperham.com/2012/08/25/using-statsd-with-rails/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty high level description of some of the implementation patterns of devops: testing, build pipelines, infrastructure as code, etc. Takes the view that much of this is about flattening organisation structures to avoid misaligned incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/agile/library/a-devops1/index.html?ca=drs-&amp;amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&quot;&gt;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/agile/library/a-devops1/index.html?ca=drs-&amp;amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs at the FT&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times is well known for doing impressive things with their adaptive HTML5 web apps on tablets and phones, and their Labs team is now looking for a webops engineer to support the scaling out of the FT web app (&lt;a href=&quot;http://app.ft.com&quot;&gt;http://app.ft.com&lt;/a&gt;) amongst other challenging web applications. To find out more and to apply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.ft.com/jobs/webops&quot;&gt;http://labs.ft.com/jobs/webops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test Kitchen is a new integrated testing environment for Chef, built by the folks from Opscode. It provides a DSL for describing all kinds of tests and checks, along with integration with Vagrant for running up virtual machines for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen&quot;&gt;https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often find myself creating host entries for vagrant virtual machines. Not only is that another step, but tidying them up afterwards can easily be forgotten. This vagrant plugin fixes that rather nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mosaicxm/vagrant-hostmaster&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mosaicxm/vagrant-hostmaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks building tools around Graphite, often that will happily run on Heroku or similar. Here&amp;rsquo;s a good example, Rorschach is a self service alerting tool for Graphite. Define metrics to check, thresholds and how you want to be notified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danryan/rorschach&quot;&gt;https://github.com/danryan/rorschach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pants is a new build tool from the developers at Twitter. It&amp;rsquo;s aimed at multiple language environments and building dependent projects direct from source all while ensuring snappy builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/twitter/pants&quot;&gt;https://github.com/twitter/commons/tree/master/src/python/twitter/pants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 85 - 19th August 2012</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2012/08/19/85/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 85 &amp;ndash; 19th August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relatively quiet issue this week, probably because I&amp;rsquo;m back at work and suitably busy. Hopefully a little something for everyone; interviews, reading lists, approaches to testing, recruitment and monitoring to name a few. Devops, at least as I see it, really is a broad topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial set of talks have been announced for devopsdays Rome in October and all of them sound amazing. Early bird tickets still available too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question about whether devops is applicable to large, traditional enterprises is interesting and this pretty in-depth question and answer session with lots of smart folks makes for worthwhile reading &amp;ndash; especially if you have an interest in large company adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/articles/virtual-panel-entreprise-ready-for-devops&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/articles/virtual-panel-entreprise-ready-for-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more and more components and larger systems, an understanding of some of the theory of distributed systems is becoming increasingly useful. This is a useful, if a little dated, reading list that should provide a great start to delving into the topic from both an academic and practical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dancres.org/reading_list.html&quot;&gt;http://dancres.org/reading_list.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of vagrant setups for experimenting with various monitoring tools has also led to a growing rpm package repository of some useful tools including graphite, ganglia and logstash. A good way to get started quickly if you&amp;rsquo;re investigating new tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/our-monitoringsucks-rpm-repository-available&quot;&gt;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/our-monitoringsucks-rpm-repository-available&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring or at least recruitment is a popular topic in devops circles due I think to a growing demand or at least interest. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t specific to devops but is detailed and interesting, covering lots of reasons for leaving, joining or retaining good technical staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daedtech.com/how-to-keep-your-best-programmers&quot;&gt;http://www.daedtech.com/how-to-keep-your-best-programmers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few year ago testing configuration management code was pretty much just an interesting conversation but now we&amp;rsquo;ve got lots of tools to make it a reality. This blog post covers a range of tools useful for testing Chef code, as well as a few helpful utilities and tips for the resulting workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technology.customink.com/blog/2012/08/03/testing-chef-cookbooks/&quot;&gt;http://technology.customink.com/blog/2012/08/03/testing-chef-cookbooks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how a given application is using memory, IO and CPU can be useful when debugging problems. Monner tries to make that capability even earlier to access, including during development, be providing a useful command line wrapper that outputs utilisation information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/colinhowe/monner&quot;&gt;https://github.com/colinhowe/monner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you produce relatively complex software that you want to work across a wide variety of different environments then virtual machines are an obvious solution. With vagrant and veewee as the underlying tools, bento is a modular set of basebox definitions used by Opscode. Useful as a starting point if you have similar cross-platform challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is important, and unfortunately not something I come across too many interesting posts on in a devops context. With all the command line tools, APIs and different web interfaces we use that&amp;rsquo;s a shame. Let me know about any particularly well design tools or dashboards you know of and I&amp;rsquo;ll include them in future issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An epic two part essay on the CAP theorem and it&amp;rsquo;s application to operations and configuration management in particular. Some great points about the importance of thinking about time in designing distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PuppetConf is back later this year with what looks like an amazing list of talks. Everything from community talks to large scale case studies to some great how-to talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetconf.com/uncategorized/an-almost-complete-list-of-puppetconf-speakers-and-topics/&quot;&gt;http://puppetconf.com/uncategorized/an-almost-complete-list-of-puppetconf-speakers-and-topics/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good interview with Adam Jacob from Opscode all about Chef, configuration management, the operations ecosystem, open source companies, Perl vs Ruby, Devops and much more besides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/219&quot;&gt;http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/219&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly spend lots of time using command line applications so the recent interest in usability and interface design for command line tools is definitely of interest. Here&amp;rsquo;s a recent talk from the Scottish Ruby Conference with lots of tips and examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://johnleach.co.uk/words/1231/beautiful-command-line-interface-design-talk&quot;&gt;http://johnleach.co.uk/words/1231/beautiful-command-line-interface-design-talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another design link, this time from Heroku about the new status site. Some great insights about the design process and the problems of displaying status information in a way that&amp;rsquo;s useful to lots of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/8/6/design_of_the_status_site/&quot;&gt;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/8/6/design_of_the_status_site/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nginx is hugely configurable when needed, and here&amp;rsquo;s a nice involved example using Redis and the embedded lua scripting engine to build an LRU proxy cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mikeferrier.com/2011/05/14/my-beautiful-dark-twisted-reverse-proxy-LRU-cache/&quot;&gt;http://mikeferrier.com/2011/05/14/my-beautiful-dark-twisted-reverse-proxy-LRU-cache/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing dependencies is a common problem and one approach is to vendor the third party code inside your application. Here&amp;rsquo;s a great blog post digging into the pros and cons of this approach and why it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes a useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bitprophet.org/blog/2012/06/07/on-vendorizing/&quot;&gt;http://bitprophet.org/blog/2012/06/07/on-vendorizing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the latest release of MySQL (5.6.6) bundles the memcached daemon and exposes some interesting interfaces to using it alongside SQL. This post covers a few of the potential usecases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.serverdensity.com/mysql-server-now-includes-embedded-memcached-for-performance/&quot;&gt;http://blog.serverdensity.com/mysql-server-now-includes-embedded-memcached-for-performance/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tool aimed at the content from this newsletter, index-weekly parses the contents into an elasticsearch index to make finding that elusive link easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alcy/index-weekly&quot;&gt;https://github.com/alcy/index-weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting project to build useful git hooks for working with Puppet. Currently contains a pre commit hook which checks for syntax, parsing and template errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smarchive/puppet-git-hooks&quot;&gt;https://github.com/smarchive/puppet-git-hooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using lots of tools for monitoring tends to favour those with APIs. Here&amp;rsquo;s a great example script which takes information from Pingdom and exports it to Graphite. Bonus points for the backfill option and general configurability of the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lewg/pingdom-to-graphite&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lewg/pingdom-to-graphite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shameless self promotion, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with Riemann recently and have released a few projects to make getting started easier. This includes a Vagrant configuration and Puppet module, along with a sample Riemann configuration and sample dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lots of previous links and general discussions it&amp;rsquo;s great to see Netflix release the first money in the Simian Army this week. Hopefully having the code out in the wild will spur others to both try the technique and modify the code for a wider audience. With 32 forks at the time of writing I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely keep an eye out for a future clone army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good argument that smaller projects can benefit from upfront automation maybe even more than the day job. The fact a group of people are doing something every day gives you some protection against losing knowledge, while personal projects can have big gaps between work being done on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wirewd.com/hacks/blog/devops_integration/&quot;&gt;http://www.wirewd.com/hacks/blog/devops_integration/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A presentation from the recent devops days event in Melbourne, all about continuous delivery and deployment. It&amp;rsquo;s quite high level but does feature a few useful workflow diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/NigelFds/devops-days-melbourne-meetup-13789963&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/NigelFds/devops-days-melbourne-meetup-13789963&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone likes systems designed to automatically failover in case of problems, but that can lead to another problem: flapping. This post describes the problem and some of the strategies available to protect against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.serverdensity.com/avoiding-flapping/&quot;&gt;http://blog.serverdensity.com/avoiding-flapping/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about Infrastructure as a Service models is that it makes cost incredibly tactical and therefore something that should be of interest to the day to day systems administration of at least larger environments. This analysis of pricing patterns of different suppliers caught my eye and makes for interesting reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2012/08/02/iaas-pricing/&quot;&gt;http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2012/08/02/iaas-pricing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good post on integrating feedback from an IRC bot into a development workflow, the examples show parsing of ruby error messages from Jenkins logs but the workflow would be usable in any similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3scale.github.com/2012/06/06/irc-driven-developement/&quot;&gt;http://3scale.github.com/2012/06/06/irc-driven-developement/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting insight into why OmniTI decided to create and maintain the new Solaris based distribution OmniOS. Covers most of the reasons why nothing quite fit and does a good job of selling tools like zones, zfs and dtrace at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omniti.com/seeds/why-omnios&quot;&gt;http://omniti.com/seeds/why-omnios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much talked about Chaos Monkey from Netflix has been released for others to play with. It&amp;rsquo;s very opinionated in that it relies on several of the Amazon APIs but if you&amp;rsquo;re running a large, dynamic, operation on EC2 then it will definitely be worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium is a handy tool but running tests in a full browser can get slow pretty quickly. Ghostdriver is a work in progress project to get allow tests to run on PhantomJS, a blazing fast headless browser. Worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instapaper is a great service, and one I use to collect links for Devops Weekly. This service from Sean Porter completes that cycle, allowing folks to subscribe and have all the links from each Devops Weekly issue arrive in their Instapaper queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I spent last week in Ruby land going by this weeks links. Software releases, Rails deployment notes, useful libraries and more. It definitely feels like having Ruby in your toolkit is useful, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not your main language for application development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various people have been talking about HTTP/2.0 recently in the standardisation community. Worth reading is this response from the Varnish developers about what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with HTTP and why the current proposals don&amp;rsquo;t address the right problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2012JulSep/0172.html&quot;&gt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2012JulSep/0172.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice summary of ways to clean up Rails deployment workflows, at least for smaller environments. Not too much detail but a goo checklist that&amp;rsquo;s relevant to most environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.siyelo.com/rails-deployment-audit&quot;&gt;http://blog.siyelo.com/rails-deployment-audit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreman, the infrastructure management tool, has hit the 1.0 release minestone. Lots of improvements to the user interface as well as experimental support for OpenStack and VMWare environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/ReleaseNotes#Release-Notes-for-10&quot;&gt;http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/ReleaseNotes#Release-Notes-for-10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinderalla is a fully managed development environment for open source hacking on Mac OSX, managed using homebrew and Chef. It supports a range of languages, databases and other tools and won&amp;rsquo;t stomp on your existing setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atmos/cinderella&quot;&gt;https://github.com/atmos/cinderella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding HTTP caching is well worth the time investment if you&amp;rsquo;re doing anything on the web. This article contributed to the Heroku knowledge base is a great introduction, and relevant outside Heroku too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/increasing-application-performance-with-http-cache-headers&quot;&gt;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/increasing-application-performance-with-http-cache-headers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty interested in expanding the whole monitoring toolchains we&amp;rsquo;re building to more than operational metrics. Everything from business information to project management data is fair game. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of getting GitHub commit data into Graphite via a webhook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://obfuscurity.com/2012/07/Trending-your-GitHub-Commits-in-Graphite&quot;&gt;http://obfuscurity.com/2012/07/Trending-your-GitHub-Commits-in-Graphite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice looking open source exception tracking tool that&amp;rsquo;s compatible with the Airbrake hosted service API. Particularly useful if you&amp;rsquo;re in an environment where tracking exceptions in a third party service just won&amp;rsquo;t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/errbit/errbit&quot;&gt;https://github.com/errbit/errbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has an over abundance of HTTP client libraries but Transport looks pretty useful if you&amp;rsquo;re building API clients. It&amp;rsquo;s quite high level but aims to provide all the common tools you&amp;rsquo;d need (like timeouts, dealing with headers, deserialisation, etc.) based on some sensible conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/songkick/transport&quot;&gt;https://github.com/songkick/transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to quickly parse log files for useful information is a handy technique, and graphene aims to make that easier without having to remembering regex patterns or sed and awk magic. It also supports generating graphs with very little code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 81 &amp;ndash; 22nd July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad the attempts to define devops have died down a bit, my favourite thing about the term and the resulting community is just how varied the topics of interest are. Workflows, security and automation, costs and performance, low level TCP tuning to name a few from this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disagreements are important and this post, about the dangers of placing too much importance on monitoring, is worth reading. The important takeaway is probably that different environments are different and have differing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swreflections.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/monitoring-sucks-but-monitoring-as.html&quot;&gt;http://swreflections.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/monitoring-sucks-but-monitoring-as.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent detailed blog post about all sorts of assumptions about HTTPS. It&amp;rsquo;s a good starting point for why HSTS is so important and goes into just enough detail about various problems it solves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/07/19/hope9talk.html&quot;&gt;http://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/07/19/hope9talk.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether rolling back a deployment is ever a good idea is an oft debated subject, but this blog post makes the case that it&amp;rsquo;s an important tool to have at your disposal. It also covers a few pointers on how to deal with rollbacks successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://benjaminwootton.co.uk/how-to-do-rollback-well/&quot;&gt;http://benjaminwootton.co.uk/how-to-do-rollback-well/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good post about the changing role of security in a more agile development environment. It proposes changing security from a gatekeeping function to much more of a consulting approach &amp;ndash; and relying on assured automation for some of the gatekeeping functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://h30458.www3.hp.com/us/us/ezine/security-leaders/jul/speed-and-security--just-add-automation---hp.html&quot;&gt;http://h30458.www3.hp.com/us/us/ezine/security-leaders/jul/speed-and-security--just-add-automation---hp.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deploying Rails book has been released and should be a good read for any Ruby developers or operations people out there. It covers quite a bit of non-Rails specific software too including Vagrant, Ganglia, Nagios and Puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pragprog.com/book/cbdepra/deploying-rails&quot;&gt;http://pragprog.com/book/cbdepra/deploying-rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good presentation about the importance of Vagrant being in defining workflows, not in the software itself. It contains short descriptions of different developer and operations focused workflows along with pros and cons of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/u/mitchellh/p/vagrant-usage-patterns&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/u/mitchellh/p/vagrant-usage-patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;TCP is tunable. It pays to know your socket flags&amp;rdquo; states this blog post with a great example of how to reduce latency of certain types of low level operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.boundary.com/2012/05/02/know-a-delay-nagles-algorithm-and-you/&quot;&gt;http://blog.boundary.com/2012/05/02/know-a-delay-nagles-algorithm-and-you/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon have launched new EC2 instance types with SSDs and Netflix took a bunch of them for a spin. This detailed blog post is worth reading just for the technical benchmarking and the insight it gives into how tweaking instance types can save money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/benchmarking-high-performance-io-with.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/benchmarking-high-performance-io-with.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s System Administrator Appreciation Day on this Friday, July 27th. If that&amp;rsquo;s not you then remember to encourage everyone around you to appreciate your systems administrator colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadminday.com/&quot;&gt;http://sysadminday.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mouth is a self contained metrics collection daemon using Ruby and MongoDB. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to other services but provides the storage, collection (over UDP) and user interface all in one package making installation and management easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cypriss/mouth&quot;&gt;https://github.com/cypriss/mouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d been looking for a dependency management tool for Puppet for a while and librarian-puppet looks excellent. It supports modules from the Puppet forge as well as via git repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably because I had three days holiday this week I appear to have found even more content than usual. Or everyone else has taken some holiday and is using the time to write up thoughts, blog posts and release some code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan Sissel, of fpm and logstash fame, wants someone to hire him to work full time on logstash. If you&amp;rsquo;d benefit from a kick-ass logging infrastructure, have billions of events per day and are interested in an awesome engineer then what are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of web operations folk are going back to academic papers or interesting areas of research and finding useful content. This post has lots of details about the field of resilience engineering that are worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting post on scaling lessons from the building of Dropbox. The idea of artificially increasing the load on your application early on is particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eranki.tumblr.com/post/27076431887/scaling-lessons-learned-at-dropbox-part-1&quot;&gt;http://eranki.tumblr.com/post/27076431887/scaling-lessons-learned-at-dropbox-part-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix have talked in lots of detail about their approach to scaling out in EC2 but this slide deck still has a few very interesting bits. In particular it has several screen shots of internal Netflx monitoring, deployment and management tools which I always like seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/stonse/netflix-cloud-platform-building-blocks&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/stonse/netflix-cloud-platform-building-blocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely introduction to log collection with logstash. Demonstrates taking haproxy logs, creating an input and then sending the events to graphite, twitter, pagerduty, circonus and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/a-boy-and-his-logs&quot;&gt;https://www.speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/a-boy-and-his-logs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good takeaway from Devopsdays last week, that simplicity is key to gaining more widespread adoption of the devops movement, tools and ideas. I do read entire technical books, and cookery books, but then I guess I&amp;rsquo;m an early adopter type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://asheepapart.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/keep-it-simple-stupid.html&quot;&gt;http://asheepapart.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/keep-it-simple-stupid.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another follow up post to Devopsdays, this one talking about the strong, and often ignored. focus on culture within the devops community. Some good points about tools being a required part of a cultural change and that not everyone is involved for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swreflections.blogspot.ca/2012/07/does-devops-have-culture-problem.html&quot;&gt;http://swreflections.blogspot.ca/2012/07/does-devops-have-culture-problem.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying multiple times a day in a regulated environment can be tricky, this take covers how Etsy deal with the challenges in a PCI environment. The line &amp;ldquo;Make sure that the team is on board and realizes that yes, there’s going to be some constraints&amp;rdquo; struck a chord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://continuousdelivery.com/2012/07/pci-dss-and-continuous-deployment-at-etsy/&quot;&gt;http://continuousdelivery.com/2012/07/pci-dss-and-continuous-deployment-at-etsy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another indication of the spread of devops ideas, these posts from Martin Fowler describing familiar concepts with details; the server configuration as unique snow flake and the phoenix server being rebuilt easily from scratch time and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PhoenixServer.html&quot;&gt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PhoenixServer.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html&quot;&gt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call for proposals is out for the upcoming Devopsdays event in Rome in October. If you have a good idea for a talk, panel or an ignite session then get submitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/propose/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/propose/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registration is now open for the excellent Velocity conference in London in October. And for lucky devopsweekly readers here&amp;rsquo;s a discount code for 20% off the ticket price: DEVOPS20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2012&quot;&gt;http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshelf is another take on a dependency management tool for Chef recipes, inspired by Bundler in ruby. Excellent documentation should make getting started easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://berkshelf.com/&quot;&gt;http://berkshelf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having all your monitoring tools able to talk to each other helps with both trying out new tools and with not being locked in as things change. Here&amp;rsquo;s a good example, a plugin for Nagios to export metrics to the Server Density software as a service platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boxedice/nagios-to-sd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/boxedice/nagios-to-sd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 79 &amp;ndash; 8th July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly varied issue this week with web based tools, command line applications, extensive notes from conferences, discussions of workflows and case studies of bug hunts to name a few topics. When folks aren&amp;rsquo;t spending time discussing what devops is (or isn&amp;rsquo;t) everyone is talking about super interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned the online book The Architecture of Open Source Applications before but it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing so again. It&amp;rsquo;s filled with fantastic chapters on interesting technologies. Here&amp;rsquo;s a couple of particular relevant chapters on nginx and puppet that are included in volume 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html&quot;&gt;http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aosabook.org/en/puppet.html&quot;&gt;http://www.aosabook.org/en/puppet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent velocity conference had loads of great talks and tutorials, and these notes from both days cover lots of them. Lots of links to both things mentioned and the various slide decks. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t make it well worth a bit of reading time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2012/07/06/velocity-2012-day-one/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2012/07/06/velocity-2012-day-one/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2012/07/07/velocity-2012-day-two/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2012/07/07/velocity-2012-day-two/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppet Lint is a command line tool that checks your Puppet code against the style guide from Puppet Labs. Well now it&amp;rsquo;s also been exposed as a web service, allowing files to be uploaded and reports produced. Even more handily it has a GitHub post commit hook to lint public repos when they are pushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kartar.net/2012/06/puppet-online-linter/&quot;&gt;http://www.kartar.net/2012/06/puppet-online-linter/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlinter.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlinter.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article about the relationship between Quality Assurance folks and the devops movement. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I agree with all of it but the idea of explicit bugs against practices and processes is not something I&amp;rsquo;d considered previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mtomlins.blogspot.fr/2012/07/testing-as-essential-dependency-for.html&quot;&gt;http://mtomlins.blogspot.fr/2012/07/testing-as-essential-dependency-for.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice article on monitoring driven development with Chef. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t give any concrete examples but it does suggest how a before and after workflow and talks about some of the merits of the existing Chef testing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jschneiderhan.posterous.com/chef-development-process-improvements&quot;&gt;http://jschneiderhan.posterous.com/chef-development-process-improvements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick write-up from Mozilla about the leap second bug, how they discovered the problem and how they went about fixing it. Lots of details too in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mozilla.org/it/2012/06/30/mysql-and-the-leap-second-high-cpu-and-the-fix/&quot;&gt;http://blog.mozilla.org/it/2012/06/30/mysql-and-the-leap-second-high-cpu-and-the-fix/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jclouds is the excellent Java based cloud provider API abstraction library, and the new jclouds command line interface tool looks great. It provides an interactive prompt for managing cloud instances from around 30 different providers or stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds-cli&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds-cli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haibu is a node.js application server, which might not be of immediate use to everyone. What is worth looking at even if you&amp;rsquo;re not using node is the interfaces. Everything is available as JSON over HTTP, from restarting applications to deploying new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu&quot;&gt;https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barkeep is a very nice looking code review tool which aims to address some of the deficiencies of other similar offerings. In particular it&amp;rsquo;s a post-commit tool rather than the pre-commit approach taken by GitHub pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getbarkeep.org/&quot;&gt;http://getbarkeep.org/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of conferences at the moment it seems, so lots of videos, slide decks and follow-up blog posts it seems. Devopsdays was the big event this last week, along with velocity. Anyone who made it along and has some good links do let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays might have just finished days ago but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped someone getting the videos from all the sessions up online already. They need a bit of editing and some titles would help but if you really can&amp;rsquo;t wait to jump in then take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the stand-out sessions at Devopsdays this last week was about the importance of culture to the devops movement. I&amp;rsquo;ve spotted a couple of good blog posts on the subject coming out of that session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opsbs.com/index.php/2012/06/devops-is-culture-so-is-a-lot-of-other-stuff/&quot;&gt;http://www.opsbs.com/index.php/2012/06/devops-is-culture-so-is-a-lot-of-other-stuff/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last week I had the good luck to be one of the speakers at the first CloudEast conference in my home town of Cambridge. I did an introduction to infrastructure as code which might not be new to readers of this newsletter but certainly got a few people from different backgrounds interested in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/u/garethr/p/infrastructure-as-code&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/u/garethr/p/infrastructure-as-code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not included a Vagrant post for a while so here&amp;rsquo;s a lovely looking slide deck from the author of Vagrant about the benefits of a virtual machine based development workflow. Lots of good straightforward arguments to use when convincing others too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/u/mitchellh/p/develop-and-test-configuration-management-scripts-with-vagrant&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/u/mitchellh/p/develop-and-test-configuration-management-scripts-with-vagrant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 had a large region outage this week and lots more people had problems. This post covers some of the problems and what you can do to mitigate problems from other such large supplier outages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.rainforestapp.com/post/26217277790/a-rough-guide-to-keeping-your-website-up-through&quot;&gt;http://blog.rainforestapp.com/post/26217277790/a-rough-guide-to-keeping-your-website-up-through&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite Splunk focused but this presentation makes a good argument that log files can be a better source for analytics than a traditional business warehouse approach. Contains some good and bad examples of log messages and a few other practical tips useful in any application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good article about more closely integration security detection and testing with the development cycle. Some good advice about logging, investigating out of ordinary load patterns and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-Wh1t3-Rabbit-Down/Detecting-unknown-application-vulnerabilities-quot-in-flight/ba-p/5693571#.T_Aqwo59nlK&quot;&gt;http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-Wh1t3-Rabbit-Down/Detecting-unknown-application-vulnerabilities-quot-in-flight/ba-p/5693571#.T_Aqwo59nlK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across Brooklyn at CLoudEast during one of the talks. It&amp;rsquo;s a Java based application deployment tool with a fancy looking web interface. You describe in code everything from what you want installed to how it should scale up and down if various monitoring checks show a need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brooklyncentral.github.com/&quot;&gt;http://brooklyncentral.github.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credmgr is a new tool aimed at securely managing privileged account credentials via shamir secret sharing. A common use case might be when you really do need a root password but don&amp;rsquo;t want to store those insecurely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 77 &amp;ndash; 24th June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally find articles on the culture aspects of devops harder to come by, so I was pleasantly surprised to find three excellent related posts this week. Applying scientific methods to asking why devops is a good thing, reading airline accident reports to make you a better systems administrator and why distributed systems require a distributed team are all exactly the type of things I want to read more of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent detailed blog post about the roots of devops, with lots of focus on the communication and collaboration angle. It applies the scientific method of promise theory to the world of dev and ops and makes a strong argument about why the devops movement is proving successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cfengine.com/markburgess/blog_devops.html&quot;&gt;http://cfengine.com/markburgess/blog_devops.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists of things to make you a better systems administrator tend to involve learning to code or other technical bits and pieces. This one involves reading airline accident reports and medical case reports. A great argument for seeing how other professionals report on failures with the aim of improving the situation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2012/06/3-activities-that-will-make-you-a-better-sysadmin/&quot;&gt;http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2012/06/3-activities-that-will-make-you-a-better-sysadmin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix have been talking lots of the technology behind distributed systems recently but this post covers what that means to the people operating the platform. The operations team has moved from a centralised organisation to a more distributed one, embedded within the development organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/06/netflix-operations-part-i-going.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/06/netflix-operations-part-i-going.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the move to infrastructure automation the APIs we use are increasingly important. This post makes a good case for consolidation around existing APIs rather than everyone creating their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gardeviance.org/2012/06/on-competing-with-apis.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.gardeviance.org/2012/06/on-competing-with-apis.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent looking slide deck on the future of deployment. I&amp;rsquo;d love to see the talk live or on video as some of the points aren&amp;rsquo;t clear just with the slides but it&amp;rsquo;s still well worth going through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/u/drnic/p/future-of-deployment-goruco-2012&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/u/drnic/p/future-of-deployment-goruco-2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub are well know for having lots of internally developed tools which do everything from surface monitoring information to deploy code to order pizza. This presentation talks about why and about using tools to raise the proficiency of everyone in an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/u/kneath/p/building-an-army-of-robots&quot;&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/u/kneath/p/building-an-army-of-robots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logstash is a fantastic swiss army knife of a tool that everyone should take a look at. Examples can make getting started easier as well as make common tasks quicker for the already converted. Enter the community cookbook for logstash recipes. Very handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cookbook.logstash.net/&quot;&gt;http://cookbook.logstash.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time the Chef server may have been quite involved to install, but now we have a few very simple tools. Knife-server is a knife plugin which can currently summon a new server with one command. Other upcoming features like backup and restore sound interesting too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 76 &amp;ndash; 17th June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good number of tools links this week, and one thing that struck me was the range of things I find interesting for this newsletter. New databases, DNS hacks, logging and metrics collection tools, deployment scripts and statistical analysis. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping everyone else is at least a little interested in quite such a wide range of different tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people probably spotted the downtime for one of the EC2 availability zones this week. One particular response made the rather bold claim that private cloud setups avoid all these issues and are cheaper to boot. This follow up post from HP explained why that&amp;rsquo;s probably not the case in most situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-Wh1t3-Rabbit-Down/The-Patchwork-Cloud-To-rent-or-buy-your-cloud/bc-p/5692227&quot;&gt;http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-Wh1t3-Rabbit-Down/The-Patchwork-Cloud-To-rent-or-buy-your-cloud/bc-p/5692227&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke earlier in the year at the excellent Bacon conference and the videos of the talks have started to make it online. One talk, entitled Building a resilient cloud infrastructure, tells the story of how Brightbox (who kindly sponsor this newsletter) built their cloud stack from available open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting look back in time at how, 20 years ago, one of the Sun offices did configuration management. I&amp;rsquo;m sure lots of smart folks had hand rolled solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hlangeveld.tumblr.com/post/25156252581/nothing-new-under-the-sun-cool-stuff-by-joyent&quot;&gt;http://hlangeveld.tumblr.com/post/25156252581/nothing-new-under-the-sun-cool-stuff-by-joyent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure lots of readers are on the look out for smart colleagues, and this article has a few hints if you&amp;rsquo;re trying the recruit devops minded folk. Apparently we&amp;rsquo;re mainly squirrel shaped people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/2240157660/How-do-you-fill-DevOps-jobs-Hire-squirrels&quot;&gt;http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/2240157660/How-do-you-fill-DevOps-jobs-Hire-squirrels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick list of things learned during a ten month stint working within a rapidly growing startup. A few interesting points about the meaning of legacy, the helpfulness of user groups and a desire to fight sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dodizzle.com/lessons-learn-while-devopsposterous&quot;&gt;http://dodizzle.com/lessons-learn-while-devopsposterous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perils and merits of feature branching are often discussed, and one of the problems of moving to such an approach is how it works with continuous integration. This post covers how to do this with Jenkins, and covers lots of the details of why, how and when not to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://entagen.github.com/jenkins-build-per-branch/&quot;&gt;http://entagen.github.com/jenkins-build-per-branch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Titan is a new open source distributed graph database which supports Casandra and HBase at the storage layer and implements a few standard graph query and object mapping API&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen lots of discussion of modelling various systems as graphs and this might be of interest in such endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/&quot;&gt;http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a talk earlier this year about all the lovely data buried inside configuration management tools, and both of the following are good examples of what you can get up to. The first takes Puppet run data and feeds it to logstash for sending wherever, the second takes Chef run data and can send it to graphite, sensu or other backends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lusis/puppet-logstash-reporter&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lusis/puppet-logstash-reporter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/portertech/chef-metrics&quot;&gt;https://github.com/portertech/chef-metrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting DNS hack. xip.io acts as a wildcard DNS server for your local network. It&amp;rsquo;s aimed at being a simple way of testing local hosts with zero configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xip.io/&quot;&gt;http://xip.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incanter is a little like the statistics language R but written in Clojure, while Nimrod is a log based metric collection server. Nimrod-incanter combines these two together, giving you a simple way of graphing or analysing data collected by Nimrod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sbtourist/nimrod-incanter&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sbtourist/nimrod-incanter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mina is another take on a remote execution tool written in Ruby. It&amp;rsquo;s very close to Rake, and comes with some build in helpers for deploying Ruby applications directly from Git. Not for everyone but very simple to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 75 &amp;ndash; 10th June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year on from the first call of #monitoringsucks, this week we have both a good writeup of what&amp;rsquo;s happened since, and some great videos from the SF Metrics meetup. The fact we now have well attended dedicated meetups (with really interesting talks) all about metrics and monitoring is great news for everyone interested in those topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Librato and Atlassian hosted the 2nd San Francisco Metrics meetup, and the videos from two of the talks have gone up. The talks cover how Heroku make operational metrics visible and a talk from Atlassian on using Hadoop to analyse conversion funnels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.librato.com/2012/06/sf-metrics-meetup-videos-visibility-at.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.librato.com/2012/06/sf-metrics-meetup-videos-visibility-at.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;monitoringsucks is a year old this week, and this post is a great summary of where it came from and more interestingly what&amp;rsquo;s happened over the last year. Some good lists of tools and some quick discussion of some trends. Good job everyone who built something or teased out the details.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/06/05/monitoring-sucking-just-a-little-bit-less/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/06/05/monitoring-sucking-just-a-little-bit-less/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice presentation entitled &amp;ldquo;Devops is a verb&amp;rdquo;. Lots of diagrams explaining where devops fits in and a start at breaking the topic down into processes, practices and importantly discussing some boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devops-is-a-verb-its-all-about-feedback-13174519&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devops-is-a-verb-its-all-about-feedback-13174519&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature Varnish has been missing that sometimes puts people off is the lack of a good persistence mechanism. Well, according to this post, it looks like it might be on the way. The post has a few details about the implementation and the branch is already available to use for anyone interested in trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.varnish-software.com/blog/persistence-varnish&quot;&gt;https://www.varnish-software.com/blog/persistence-varnish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article with six phases of Chef cookbook reuse. Showing the evolution from a very procedural cookbook style all the way to policy driven separate recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://realityforge.org/code/2012/05/12/evolving-towards-cookbook-reusability-in-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://realityforge.org/code/2012/05/12/evolving-towards-cookbook-reusability-in-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a please for any systems administrators to learn at least three programming languages. It&amp;rsquo;s a very quick argument but has a few points and some suggestions of how to decide which three languages might suit the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://commandlion.com/2012/06/03/every-sysadmin-three-languages/&quot;&gt;http://commandlion.com/2012/06/03/every-sysadmin-three-languages/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare, the CDN and web site optimisation folks, had a nasty security incident last week. But hats off to them for writing the details up for everyone else to learn from. The visualisation of the timeline is particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-four-critical-security-flaws-that-resulte&quot;&gt;http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-four-critical-security-flaws-that-resulte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vagrant autoloading plugin mechanism turned out to be quite slow so in the upcoming 1.1 release you have to specify in your configuration which plugins to load. To make that a little easier the vagrant-plugins plugin lets you list available plugins, including details about what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-plugins&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-plugins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another devopsweekly, another addition to the Graphite ecosystem. Umpire from Heroku is an HTTP interface designed to allow you to build up alerting systems. You formulate URLs which check the state of a given metric and the service returns the relevant HTTP status codes if the check passes or fails. Useful for integration with something like Pingdom or a simple HTTP check in Nagios for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 74 &amp;ndash; 3rd June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a very long weekend on holiday this week and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to get some time to play with at least a few of the things I found this last week. Some hopefully useful monitoring and instrumentation talk, ideas about the future of configuration management and provisioning tools and lots more Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service &amp;ndash; sponsors Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I somehow missed all the talk about Razor last week. It&amp;rsquo;s a provisioning tools from EMC and Puppet with the aim of being as happy in a more traditional hardware environment as with a public cloud. It makes use of mcollective and faster to do some auto-detection and then allows policies to be applied to hosts, often by handing off to Puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-razor-a-next-generation-provisioning-solution/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-razor-a-next-generation-provisioning-solution/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nickapedia.com/2012/05/21/lex-parsimoniae-cloud-provisioning-with-a-razor/&quot;&gt;http://nickapedia.com/2012/05/21/lex-parsimoniae-cloud-provisioning-with-a-razor/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m quite a fan of Fabric, and have recently started messing about with Clojure, so coming across Server-Stats piqued my interest. It&amp;rsquo;s a framework for writing parallel SSH tasks in Clojure, so define groups of hosts and then write functions which when applied to a set of hosts execute the specified commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulosuzart.github.com/blog/2012/04/17/monitoring-ec2-with-clojure-and-server-stats/&quot;&gt;http://paulosuzart.github.com/blog/2012/04/17/monitoring-ec2-with-clojure-and-server-stats/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulosuzart/Server-Stats&quot;&gt;https://github.com/paulosuzart/Server-Stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Lonelyplanet have been getting down to instrumenting lots of Ruby applications and have written up how they went about it using statsd. This let to Fozzie, a configurable and more opinionated statsd client and middleware stack useful for Ruby web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.lonelyplanet.com/monitoring-our-applications-the-statsd-way-ru&quot;&gt;http://devops.lonelyplanet.com/monitoring-our-applications-the-statsd-way-ru&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lonelyplanet/fozzie&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lonelyplanet/fozzie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good summary of a number of conversations of configuration drift. If you have hosts around long enough, the occasional or polling nature of most configuration management tools combined with only managing what is defined, means configuration will probably &amp;ldquo;drift&amp;rdquo; from what you have described. Some good points about security, what the future might see and some smart comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/05/24/configuration-drift-and-next-gen-cm/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/05/24/configuration-drift-and-next-gen-cm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good getting started with testing Chef code tutorial. Taking foodcritic (a useful linting tool) and the excellent travis ci continuous integration system to create a very quick and simple testing setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/05/29/mvt-foodcritic-and-travis-ci/&quot;&gt;http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/05/29/mvt-foodcritic-and-travis-ci/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making changes to complex relational databases while they&amp;rsquo;re running can be tricky (unless you&amp;rsquo;re paying all that money to Oracle). This post covers how Etsy have approach the thorny problem using a sharded master/master setup. One good tip &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t let the database generate anything (like auto incrementing keys).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/04/20/two-sides-for-salvation/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/04/20/two-sides-for-salvation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Call For Participation for DevOps Down Under 2012 is open. The organisers are currently looking for speakers on all subjects DevOps, and the call closes on the 18th of June. The conference will be held on the 9th and 10th of August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdownunder.org/participate/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdownunder.org/participate/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite, the increasingly handy graphing tool, has hit 0.9.10 and with it a number of worthwhile improvements and fixes, including the ability to import saved graphs, a scattering of new render functions and options, more flexibility for the web interface and support for rendering graphs in SVG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchpad.net/graphite/0.9/0.9.10&quot;&gt;https://launchpad.net/graphite/0.9/0.9.10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts of Graphite is the increasing ecosystem of tools around it, including the newly released backstop. It presents a nice http interface for submitting data to a graphite backend. Includes some simple examples of using this with collectd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 73 &amp;ndash; 27th May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; content this week, including talk of relationships with other business groups, lists of practices worth implementing, user centred organisations and a laptop made specifically for people like us. Still room for some good technical content too, Buster.JS looks great for anyone doing some high level web testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good post about he relationship between development, operations and a security function. Some good follow up comments as well, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see some more case studies around this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-White-Rabbit/What-s-in-a-name-Does-DevOps-need-a-security-flavor/ba-p/5663931&quot;&gt;http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-White-Rabbit/What-s-in-a-name-Does-DevOps-need-a-security-flavor/ba-p/5663931&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a nice list of ideal operations practices as a Gist (already with a couple of forks). Definitely worth reading through and comparing to what you&amp;rsquo;re doing at present &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d guess for most environments it would help focus on a few areas worth spending time on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2777306&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/2777306&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting collaboration between Canonical and Dell to try and make a high quality developer centric laptop. The GitHub powered templates sound interesting, as do some of the other features. Hopefully the 6 month project will bear fruit &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d love to try something like this when they fix the trackpad issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bartongeorge.net/2012/05/07/introducing-project-sputnik-developer-laptop/&quot;&gt;http://bartongeorge.net/2012/05/07/introducing-project-sputnik-developer-laptop/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer isn&amp;rsquo;t always to automate everything it seems. This post discusses some pros and cons of automating a documentation workflow but the argument stands for most processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.funnelfiasco.com/?p=1171&quot;&gt;http://blog.funnelfiasco.com/?p=1171&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good write-up of some of the discussions from GOTO about driving development work from metrics. Mentions why factoring metrics collection into your definition of done is a good idea and has a good example of a simple feature that actually generates lots of useful metrics if we choose the collect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://benjaminwootton.co.uk/metrics-driven-development/&quot;&gt;http://benjaminwootton.co.uk/metrics-driven-development/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the presentations that inspired the above blog post, Using monitoring and metrics to learn in development. Some good monitoring sucks material and a few great diagrams of where process improvements could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/using-monitoring-and-metrics-to-learn-in-development&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/using-monitoring-and-metrics-to-learn-in-development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in a very user-centred environment at the moment so this blog post made interesting reading. That we&amp;rsquo;re seeing lots of barriers broken down isn&amp;rsquo;t new, but the lists of why different groups care about items that may have been separate from their silo previous is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ingineering.it/post/23086269936/user-centered-it-and-t-shaped-people&quot;&gt;http://blog.ingineering.it/post/23086269936/user-centered-it-and-t-shaped-people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first CloudCamp North event is talking place on the 14th of June in Leeds, UK. It&amp;rsquo;s an evening affair with lots of lightning talks and a chance to talk to smart interesting folk from the likes of Brightbox (who sponsor this newsletter), Basho (of Riak fame) and HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudcampnorth-eorg.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;http://cloudcampnorth-eorg.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioned in one of the presentation from ChefConf, Spork is a Knife workflow plugin designed to help teams work with a set of cookbooks and Chef environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonlives/knife-spork&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jonlives/knife-spork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High level integration testing in browsers can often be somewhat painful, so Buster.JS looks interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s a JavaScript test framework for node and browsers; it supports running tests in local browsers, headless tests, proxying to live websites, and comes with good support for mocks and stubs and other modern testing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 72 &amp;ndash; 20th May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you have nothing planned for this next week as this issue is rather packed with content, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a Chef fan. ChefConf last week sounded like it went very well indeed, and we have lots of links to slide decks, videos and new tools included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for the UK Government I&amp;rsquo;m increasingly involved with security related concerns, so this article is pretty timely. It looks at what can be done a part of a continuous delivery pipeline when it comes to security, with mention of continuous integration, static analysis and the part played by configuration management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://365.rsaconference.com/blogs/f-stock/2012/05/18/continuous-delivery-of-secure-software&quot;&gt;http://365.rsaconference.com/blogs/f-stock/2012/05/18/continuous-delivery-of-secure-software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PuppetDB is finally out in the wild. On one hand it&amp;rsquo;s a clojure based replacement for the store configuration database, on the other it&amp;rsquo;s the start of a nice query interface to all the information Puppet collects as it goes about it&amp;rsquo;s configuration management business. Currently labelled a beta but well worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-puppetdb-put-your-data-to-work/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-puppetdb-put-your-data-to-work/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned a Gem last week we&amp;rsquo;ve been using at work for a simple continuous deployment workflow for Gems. This detailed writeup covers another approach to the same problem, using more detailed Jenkins steps and going into the whole workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hackers.mylookout.com/2012/05/continuous-deployment-for-gems/&quot;&gt;http://hackers.mylookout.com/2012/05/continuous-deployment-for-gems/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing code tends to be much easier if everyone uses a similar style. This work in progress style guide for Chef cookbooks looks interesting, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ampledata/cookbook-style-guide&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ampledata/cookbook-style-guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenShift is the new platform as a service from RedHat, offering support for Java, Ruby, Python, Node.js, PHP and Perl. It&amp;rsquo;s currently free to use, and the documentation looks good for getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openshift.redhat.com&quot;&gt;https://openshift.redhat.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great 50 month retrospective of an agile transformation, taking in automation, continuous delivery and automated testing. The comparisons of different stages of growth, the detailed numbers and the great illustrations make this a great read for anyone working in a rapidly expanding team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.targetprocess.com/articles/agile50months/&quot;&gt;http://www.targetprocess.com/articles/agile50months/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick has started documenting practices, patterns and principles indicative of successful devops projects and is looking for any and all feedback. The ultimata aim appears to be a maturity based model, but even at this stage it could make discussion around specific practices much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/05/12/codifying-devops-area-practices/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/05/12/codifying-devops-area-practices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great presentation from inside Etsy about managing a devops flavoured operations team in a rapidly growing company. Lots of tips on people, processes, hiring and management in general. Some good insider details too about using Kanban successfully and using metrics (Etsy now have more than 280,000 individual metrics!) to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mrembetsy/devops-picc12-management-talk&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/mrembetsy/devops-picc12-management-talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging is important, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a big topic. Especially for those coming from a more development background the number of different types and locations of log files can be daunting. So this introductory post is good to see. It has lots of details about application logs, syslog and what to look out for in a typical web server context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.logentries.com/2012/05/logging-on-linux-part-1-ive-got-a-bunch-of-linux-boxes-what-should-i-be-looking-out-for-in-my-logs/&quot;&gt;https://blog.logentries.com/2012/05/logging-on-linux-part-1-ive-got-a-bunch-of-linux-boxes-what-should-i-be-looking-out-for-in-my-logs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ChefConf&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice general write-up of the first ChefConf event. Brief discussion of the workshops, pre-conference hack day and some of the stand-out talks. Sounds like it was a great event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ducea.com/2012/05/18/chefconf-2012-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;http://www.ducea.com/2012/05/18/chefconf-2012-san-francisco/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the stand-out talks from the conference from what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, Avoiding Kitchen Nightmares contains lots of tooling and workflow tips and tricks for Chef users. Testing, linting and release workflows are all discussed in some detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mcdonnps/lessons-from-etsy-avoiding-kitchen-nightmares-chefconf-2012&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/mcdonnps/lessons-from-etsy-avoiding-kitchen-nightmares-chefconf-2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regularly featured Food Fight podcast went into overdrive at ChefConf, producing 7 short updates and an R Rated final recap. That should keep you busy till next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012_05_01_archive.html&quot;&gt;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012_05_01_archive.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if that&amp;rsquo;s not enough and you&amp;rsquo;re looking for even more links, slides and videos this week then the Food Fight folk are collecting all the links to #ChefConf material on GitHub. A good number of the videos are already up on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foodfight/showz/blob/master/chefconf_slides.md&quot;&gt;https://github.com/foodfight/showz/blob/master/chefconf_slides.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimrod is a metrics server purely based on log processing. Your application outputs logs according to a simple format and Nimrod consumes these and presents metrics (gauges, counters, timers, etc.) information over an HTTP interface for other applications to consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sbtourist.github.com/nimrod/&quot;&gt;http://sbtourist.github.com/nimrod/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sbtourist/nimrod&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sbtourist/nimrod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StarCluster from MIT is a Python tool for summoning and controlling a cluster of EC2 machines aimed at scientific computation. It includes tools for map/reduce, parallel processing, linear algebra and scientific algorithms amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/star/cluster/&quot;&gt;http://web.mit.edu/star/cluster/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sous Chef is a nifty looking tool from the Travis CI folks for testing Chef cookbooks with a local vagrant powered virtual machine. It&amp;rsquo;s predominantly a well documented workflow and a sample Vagrantfile, but worth a look for a few good tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chefconf kicks off in a couple of days in San Francisco so have fun and learn lots anyone lucky enough to be going along. Looks a good mix of workshops, hacking spaces, talks, live podcasts and computer games. Hopefully lots of links to content next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post showing how to use Chef and Vagrant to quickly start working on a new project. Very simple walkthrough, and good example of using the excellent Librarian to manage cookbooks. Contains good Cheffile and Vagrantfile examples that you can start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.base2.io/2012/05/01/vagrants-and-chefs-and-librarians-oh-my/&quot;&gt;http://blog.base2.io/2012/05/01/vagrants-and-chefs-and-librarians-oh-my/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good couple of articles going into setting up a KVM host from scratch. Details network and libvert configuration as well as using the ubuntu-vm-builder tool for creating new machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptocracy.com/blog/2012/05/06/a-dedicated-server/&quot;&gt;http://www.cryptocracy.com/blog/2012/05/06/a-dedicated-server/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup of Sprint.ly’s continuous integration setup. Good to see another example of folks using system packages and detailing the benefits. The use of mapping distributions to environments is neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sprint.ly/post/22794189287/nerd-alert-sprint-lys-continuous-integration&quot;&gt;http://blog.sprint.ly/post/22794189287/nerd-alert-sprint-lys-continuous-integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Etsy&amp;rsquo;s deployinator this company went about turning a very manual, error prone, process into something much more automated. Mainly of interest due to the stack; Mercurial, JRuby, ColdFusion and Windows isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the common case so it&amp;rsquo;s good to see success with automation isn&amp;rsquo;t just about one set of tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flydillonfly.wordpress.com/2012/05/06/how-etsy-helped-us-deploy/&quot;&gt;http://flydillonfly.wordpress.com/2012/05/06/how-etsy-helped-us-deploy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite is great for storing ad-hoc metrics and data easily, but once you&amp;rsquo;ve started to throw lots of data in you start to think about how maybe you should have organised things. This post has a few tips, mainly simple rules to follow and importantly points out you can move and resize metrics easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://obfuscurity.com/2012/05/Organizing-Your-Graphite-Metrics&quot;&gt;http://obfuscurity.com/2012/05/Organizing-Your-Graphite-Metrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good detailed presentation about moving to a service based architecture. Lots of examples and arguments and counter-arguments for different approaches. And lots and lots of diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/chris.e.richardson/decomposing-applications-for-scalability-and-deployability-april-2012&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/chris.e.richardson/decomposing-applications-for-scalability-and-deployability-april-2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not had a &amp;ldquo;what is devops&amp;rdquo; post for a while, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to still see them cropping up. In this case we have a number of examples why things might be changing along with some of the value a Devops approach can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zkybase.org/blog/2012/05/08/devops-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-be-doing-it/&quot;&gt;http://zkybase.org/blog/2012/05/08/devops-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-be-doing-it/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 5th Puppet Camp is making it to South East Asia, in particular to Kuala Lumpur. With Tokyo, Delhi and Sydney on the list of Devopsdays events this year too, this whole thing has definitely gone global.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetcampsea.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;http://puppetcampsea.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One from a work colleague. We have a continuous delivery setup at work that works pretty well for applications, but not at all for the associated ruby libraries we publish. Gem Publisher helps with that, providing a Rake task which will publish our gems only if the version has been incremented, and hooked up with Jenkins only then if the tests pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/gem_publisher&quot;&gt;https://github.com/alphagov/gem_publisher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seyren is another dashboard for Graphite, but this time the focus is on generating alerts from the collected data. The web interface acts as a self service console for alerts, allowing you to set any thresholds you&amp;rsquo;re interested in and where any message should be sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scobal/seyren&quot;&gt;https://github.com/scobal/seyren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avery is a real-time time-based metric storage, retrieval, and graphing service. It presents a very simple web service for storing data in an RRD-like format and displaying graphs that update as new data is pushed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OMGPOP/avery&quot;&gt;https://github.com/OMGPOP/avery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks starting to use parts of OpenStack lately it seems. Supernova aims to help with the problem where you are dealing with multiple Nova API endpoints. Swapping environment variables around is no fun so this utility wraps everything in a handy command line and provides a configuration file to name configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rackerhacker/supernova&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rackerhacker/supernova&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 70 &amp;ndash; 6th May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more of the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with recently come with a flexible plugin system to make extending them easier. Mentioned in this issue Mcollective, Vagrant, Ansible and Agent99 are all based around a plugin system that isn&amp;rsquo;t just an afterthought. Anyone building developer and operations tools should think about what that means for their software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent presentation from last year about how SimpleGeo architect their systems. Lots of good examples and details about deployment, phased rollouts and some of the tools they have built in-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mmalone/architecture-at-simplegeo-staying-agile-at-scale&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/mmalone/architecture-at-simplegeo-staying-agile-at-scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice post extolling the power of the Graylog2 web interface. Graylog2 is a tool for indexing log information and providing a nice elastic searchinterface to it. This post shows a couple of examples of the types of useful query you can run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boojapathy.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/power-of-graylog2-web-interface/&quot;&gt;http://boojapathy.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/power-of-graylog2-web-interface/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting idea to break monitoring down into 6 distinct elements a log with definitions. System monitoring, Dependency monitoring, Integration, Business activity monitoring, Tracing and Complex event processing. Categorisation like this can be useful, in particular with all the talk of framework based approaches to monitoring tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ranjib.posterous.com/monitoring&quot;&gt;http://ranjib.posterous.com/monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Microsoft writeup of a continuous integration and deployment setup. Talks about moving from SVN, Nant and Cruisecontrol to Mercurial, Powershell and Teamcity with lots of good examples of the code and configuration used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/towards-the-perfect-build/&quot;&gt;http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/towards-the-perfect-build/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcollective 2.0.0 is out, with lots of new features and additions for those not tracking the development branch. Several packaging enhancements (the client is available as a gem, plugins can be automatically packages as debs or rpms and Windows support is available) as well as enhancements to how messages are passed to avoid common problems make this an essential upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/releasenotes.html#2_0_0&quot;&gt;http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/releasenotes.html#2_0_0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presentation from the recent RailsConf selling operations to a predominantly developer audience. Lots of content on virtualised development environments, branching strategies, continuous deployment and more. Worth watching whether or not you&amp;rsquo;re a Ruby person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://confreaks.com/videos/882-railsconf2012-taming-the-kraken-how-operations-enables-developer-productivity&quot;&gt;http://confreaks.com/videos/882-railsconf2012-taming-the-kraken-how-operations-enables-developer-productivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nifty vagrant plugin that allows for managing local DNS entries for vagrant machines. It runs a local DNS server and provides commands to hook that into the OSX DNS resolution system. It&amp;rsquo;s been developed by the Berlin Vagrant user group too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BerlinVagrant/vagrant-dns/tree/v0.2.0&quot;&gt;https://github.com/BerlinVagrant/vagrant-dns/tree/v0.2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people have been using IRC and chat bots (like Hubot) to manage and communicate with infrastructure components, and OpsBot is a set of simple scripts for a Jabber bot to do just that. It currently features plugins for Nagios and RT and looks easy enough to extend with additional Perl scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alcy/OpsBot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/alcy/OpsBot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, Agent99 is another bot &amp;ndash; this time providing both an IRC and HTTP interface. It&amp;rsquo;s very pluggable but ships with only a few examples, though the GitHub post-recieve hook one is a great example of why mixing IRC and HTTP could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/99designs/agent99&quot;&gt;https://github.com/99designs/agent99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ansible is a new entry into the open source configuration management space, looking to blend some idempotent management tools and simple remote execution capability into a single plugin-centric tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ansible.github.com/&quot;&gt;http://ansible.github.com/&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 69 &amp;ndash; 29th April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less blog posts or articles this week, but lots of presentations, podcasts and some interesting looking tools to make up for it. I think my spare time has been filled up with creating the slides for Bacon for the last few weeks so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll find some more time now that&amp;rsquo;s done to find and read all the interesting things folks are writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend at the Bacon conference in London I got a chance to present all about #monitoringsucks. This is mainly an introduction to the subject, along with a sort of story so far and some of the new emerging tools. The video of the talk should be available in the not-too-distant future too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/garethr/p/monitoring-sucks&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/garethr/p/monitoring-sucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying applications is still hard or at least confusing to get started with. This article covers several patterns and anti-patterns around deploying Python applications and is a pretty good starting point. Many of these can be applied to similar technology stacks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hynek.me/articles/python-deployment-anti-patterns/&quot;&gt;http://hynek.me/articles/python-deployment-anti-patterns/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Devops Cafe keeps making a comeback, and this episode features a great chat with Adam Jacobs, Chef author and co-founder of Opscode. Discussion ranges from the state of the cloud, to DevOps for business transformation, to building an open source community, to automated orchestration. Well worth a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2012/4/23/devops-cafe-episode-26.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2012/4/23/devops-cafe-episode-26.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice presentation from Amazon about continues deployment patterns in cloud environments. Some of it is specific to AWS but the most of it is relevant in any reasonably dynamic environment. Some good diagrams and examples of continuous integration setups and approaches to database migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/cloudpowered-continuous-integration-and-deployment-architectures-jinesh-varia&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/cloudpowered-continuous-integration-and-deployment-architectures-jinesh-varia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article on patch management (honestly). It discusses two alternative approaches to managing patch levels in highly dynamic cloud environments &amp;ndash; specifically upgrading things in place and upgrading by replacing the entire virtual machine. Good discussion of why you might favour one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-White-Rabbit/Patch-Management-in-the-Cloud-It-s-About-Consistency-and/ba-p/5484167&quot;&gt;http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-White-Rabbit/Patch-Management-in-the-Cloud-It-s-About-Consistency-and/ba-p/5484167&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just not possible to have too many Graphite dashboards it seems. Tasseo looks excellent, able to show a large number of configurable metrics at a glance. Looks perfect for a big screen in any office already using Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/obfuscurity/tasseo&quot;&gt;https://github.com/obfuscurity/tasseo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cumberbatch is another tool in the growing pursuit of good testing tools for configuration management code. It makes use of Vagrant and Virtualbox snapshots, dynamically building rake tasks for running tests and providing hooks for cucumber features to control the resulting virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jtopper/cumberbatch&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jtopper/cumberbatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a number of tools built atop fpm recently, and bunchr looks interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s described as a Ruby/Rake DSL for building and packaging software into omnibus-style package, ie. with all required dependencies often including the language runtime. The repository provides a number of examples including Ruby and the components of the Sensu monitoring framework.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 68 &amp;ndash; 22nd April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last couple of days at the excellent Bacon (&lt;a href=&quot;http://devslovebacon.com/&quot;&gt;http://devslovebacon.com/&lt;/a&gt;) conference in London, about all things developers love. Not only did I get an opportunity to talk about why #monitoringsucks but lots of the other talks where hugely interesting and inspiring. Definitely one to look out for next year if you&amp;rsquo;re in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned BOSH last week, in particular asking if anyone had had the chance to get it up and running. Well Dr Nic Williams has done more than that, with a number of tutorials and a useful looking screencast. Definitely looks to be the best place to start if you&amp;rsquo;re investigating BOSH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drnicwilliams.com/2012/04/16/creating-a-bosh-from-scratch-on-aws/&quot;&gt;http://drnicwilliams.com/2012/04/16/creating-a-bosh-from-scratch-on-aws/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice short case study from the development operations team at Sonian. It talks about how they moved from spending most of their time responding to unplanned incidents to a much happier, proactive way of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hightechinthehub.com/2012/04/virtuous-cycle-of-devops/&quot;&gt;http://www.hightechinthehub.com/2012/04/virtuous-cycle-of-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well designed API makes a huge difference to how likely I am to investigate a new tool and eventually how likely I am to add it to a stack. This presentation from Google (in PDF) is an excellent reference to API design and if you&amp;rsquo;re building something for use by other developers is well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/slides/keynote.pdf&quot;&gt;http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/slides/keynote.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great time at PuppetConf last year in Portland and it&amp;rsquo;s back again this year, coming to San Francisco on September 27th &amp;amp; 28th this year. With five tracks of content covering all things operations and space for 700 people it should be quite an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetconf.com/&quot;&gt;http://puppetconf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How teams and companies work is always interesting, and this article about Heroku covers a few interesting points. The relative independence of separate teams, APIs and contracts between internal service teams and a focus on asynchronous communication are all discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/02/how-heroku-works-teams-tools/&quot;&gt;http://craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/02/how-heroku-works-teams-tools/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is a common subject of conversation in agile software development, and this post has some interesting points about debt from an operational point of view. The move to porting existing applications to cloud environments or wholly virtualised setups is one thing that&amp;rsquo;s driving this discussion and the post has a few examples too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ingineering.it/post/21311393348/tech-debt&quot;&gt;http://blog.ingineering.it/post/21311393348/tech-debt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks use S3 for production systems, but testing against it locally (or in a continuous integration environment) can be both slow and costly. Fake S3 aims to solve both those problem, it&amp;rsquo;s a self contained executable that mimics the S3 apis and can easily be run locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone reading this newsletter will use SSH either constantly or occasionally, so anything that can improve the experience should be a good thing. Mosh, or Mobile Shell, claims a number of useful looking features &amp;ndash; in particular better support for roaming and dropped connections as well as tricks to make things more responsive. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be giving this a go, great documentation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 67 &amp;ndash; 15th April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bumper crop of links and tools again this week, with everything from interesting new tools, an epic run of posts with tips on Graphite all from the last week or so and talk of Devops from big companies like IBM and VMWare. The community certainly feels like it&amp;rsquo;s getting bigger every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMWare have released BOSH which they describe as a &amp;ldquo;tool chain for release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services&amp;rdquo;. It took me a while to find some good docs and examples but it certainly looks interesting. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in anyone&amp;rsquo;s experiences with trying this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/documentation/documentation.md&quot;&gt;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/documentation/documentation.md&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-sample-release&quot;&gt;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-sample-release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly interesting seeing the likes of IBM talk about the devops buzz. This piece actually acts as a nice quick introduction for folks in more of an enterprise environment, and contains &amp;ldquo;a small number of concrete practices that are necessary for an enterprise to fully embrace DevOp&amp;rdquo; which actually make useful reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/invisiblethread/entry/6-ways-for-enterprises-to-adopt-devops&quot;&gt;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/invisiblethread/entry/6-ways-for-enterprises-to-adopt-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of how complex systems fail is one of interest to most systems administrators and developers and this post (from last year) makes for an interesting read. It&amp;rsquo;s main point is that &amp;ldquo;People Make Poor Monitors for Computers&amp;rdquo; and although it focuses on the problems with flying airplanes it has lots of good general points and comments worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macroresilience.com/2011/12/29/people-make-poor-monitors-for-computers/&quot;&gt;http://www.macroresilience.com/2011/12/29/people-make-poor-monitors-for-computers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people forget that Vagrantfile&amp;rsquo;s are actually just Ruby code, which means you can do all sorts of project or context specific things in them. This example takes this to quite an extreme, using the same Vagrantfile between projects but along with a project specific configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ergonlogic.com/blog/aegir-vagrant-project-templating-framework&quot;&gt;http://ergonlogic.com/blog/aegir-vagrant-project-templating-framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always happy to see more folks discovering the advantages of virtualised development environments and Vagrant in particular. This post covers a nice story and includes a few of the problems that you can solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mankindforward.com/2012/04/08/why-your-engineering-team-needs-vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://mankindforward.com/2012/04/08/why-your-engineering-team-needs-vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite is awesome. I&amp;rsquo;ve only more recently had chance to really get into using it and, although it&amp;rsquo;s immediately useful it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that some of it&amp;rsquo;s more powerful features will take time to learn. This excellent series, with 6 posts already this month, is well worth checking out for tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcollective is a fantastic framework for remote execution but it does require some upfront effort for writing plugins. This post quickly walks through writing a smile agent which wraps an existing command line tool. Very handy if you&amp;rsquo;re moving from a ssh loop based approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mague.com/?p=382&quot;&gt;http://blog.mague.com/?p=382&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience DNS tends to be one of those things that all those coming from a systems administration background understand and those from more of a developer background done. That makes this blog post hugely useful, as well as well written and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://css.dzone.com/articles/devops-dns-developers&quot;&gt;http://css.dzone.com/articles/devops-dns-developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shazam Entertainment is looking to fill a number of Service Engineering roles in our London HQ and Palo Alto office. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for passionate individuals who enjoy building and operating highly reliable services by working closely with development to design and implement strong systems architectures, CI methodologies, and insane amounts of monitoring.  We also have a number of positions in our Infrastructure Operations team for those less interested in development and more interested in network engineering, building and operating private clouds, and focusing on third party software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details or to apply send on your CV/Resume or LinkedIn profile to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#x64;&amp;#101;&amp;#x76;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#112;&amp;#115;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x68;&amp;#97;&amp;#x7a;&amp;#97;&amp;#109;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x65;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x76;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x70;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x68;&amp;#97;&amp;#122;&amp;#97;&amp;#109;&amp;#x74;&amp;#101;&amp;#97;&amp;#109;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone likes the perceived complexity of Chef or Puppet and lots of smaller shell script based frameworks seem to crop up that deal only with provisioning rather than everything else. Sunzi is one that caught my eye that has a few nice features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kenn/sunzi&quot;&gt;https://github.com/kenn/sunzi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load testing tools tend to have a bit of a barrier to entry, at least if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get useful data past the number of requests per second an individual URL can handle. Locust therefore looks interesting. Define tests in Python (similar to Funkload) but along with a very nice web based results dashboard and some distributed test running features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/cgbystrom/p/load-testing-with-locust&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/cgbystrom/p/load-testing-with-locust&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://locust.io/&quot;&gt;http://locust.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks are releasing their in-house deployment tools, which is great for picking through code and finding ideas. I&amp;rsquo;m sure at some point we&amp;rsquo;ll see a consolidation too. Brood is a PHP, XML and Gearman based tool which has just been released by IGN and might be worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.ign.com/blog/2012/04/01/continuous-deployment-with-brood&quot;&gt;http://code.ign.com/blog/2012/04/01/continuous-deployment-with-brood&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ign/brood&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ign/brood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting looking project, Metis is an implementation of the Nagios NRPE daemon written in Ruby. The emphasis appears to be on getting people to share and test monitoring code which is a worthy goal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 66 &amp;ndash; 8th April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly larger issue this week which should hopefully keep people going through the long weekend. And for anyone thinking about a change of jobs there is and a cheeky opportunity to come and work with me at the Government Digital Service :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting details of how the operations team at Spotify adopted a Kanban approach to managing there work. Nice to see information about the tools used as well as how they went about adopting and deciding upon the approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/articles/kanban-operations-spotify&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/articles/kanban-operations-spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice write-up of combining an existing syslog infrastructure with Graphite to gets logs of everything. The argument made is that if you&amp;rsquo;re already using syslog elsewhere you should need very few new moving parts to start gathering data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickflop.net/blog/2012/03/30/any-metric-graphing-with-graphite-and-syslog/&quot;&gt;http://www.kickflop.net/blog/2012/03/30/any-metric-graphing-with-graphite-and-syslog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more people are starting to post about their current monitoring setups. Not only does this make for good looking blog posts (graphs!) but most of them contain interesting tips and tricks that are worth experimenting with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2012-04-02-metrics-monitoring-infrastructure-oh-my/&quot;&gt;http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2012-04-02-metrics-monitoring-infrastructure-oh-my/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure testing is still relatively new to most people and this introductory talk by Jon Topper at the recent CukeUp event might be a useful starting point. It demonstrates a number of tools including cucumber-nagios and talks about some of the current problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/test-driven-infrastructure-cucumber&quot;&gt;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/test-driven-infrastructure-cucumber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good lighting fast slide deck on two main points of interest in operations; metrics collection and monitoring. Quick examples of good and bad log examples, approaches to common problems and things you can do to make running software easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/the-unnamed-talk&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/the-unnamed-talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short interview with Patrick Debois about the State of Devops. The questions vary from where the movement came from to what is currently of interest at the moment. Interesting, but brief, discussion of a monitoring abstraction interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/debois-devops&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/debois-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good lengthy article going inside how Facebook release software to production. It includes both technical and process details and is worth a read. Although it contains technical details it&amp;rsquo;s also friendly enough to share with more business minded colleagues. And it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see the people behind the technology too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering.ars&quot;&gt;http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering.ars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays Austin was last week and this post gave me a feeling of being there without describing the individual talks (which should be available online at some point). Lots of nice take aways from removing the hero and the villain, the move towards automation and rapid release and the interesting but so simple idea of unit tests for production security assertions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://undertitled.com/2012/04/05/devopsdays-takeaways.html&quot;&gt;http://undertitled.com/2012/04/05/devopsdays-takeaways.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram launched a new service last week and blogged about some of the tools and techniques they used on launch day. The takeaways are good, including good real time monitoring, the ability to identify where in the stack a bottleneck is occurring and doing the capacity planning and provisioning extra read capacity ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/20541814340/keeping-instagram-up-with-over-a-million-new-users-in&quot;&gt;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/20541814340/keeping-instagram-up-with-over-a-million-new-users-in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud East is a new conference focused on all things Cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s being held on the 28th of June in Cambridge, UK, which happens to be where I live. I&amp;rsquo;d love to meet up with any readers who are planning on heading along. They are also on the lookout for speakers for a variety of different sessions including tutorials, workshops and panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudeast.net&quot;&gt;http://www.cloudeast.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shameless self promotion this week I&amp;rsquo;m afraid. I&amp;rsquo;m currently hiring for sysadmin, web operations and #devops minded folks to work with me at the UK Government Digital Service. The roles are brand new and will involve everything from deployment tooling, automation and configuration management to lots of pairing with developers, security assurance and managing production systems. Any questions let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2336682&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/2336682&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm is a distributed realtime computation system, which may be of interest to a few folks. Also particularly interesting is the related deployment system. It&amp;rsquo;s built on top of Pallet, the clojure automation tool and provides a nice example repo to wander through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-deploy&quot;&gt;https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-deploy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wham looks like an interesting prototype. A very cryptic home page where you need to know what it&amp;rsquo;s for, if you enter a public GitHub repository name containing puppet modules and manifests you get a dependency graph. Try emtrane/puppet-repo for instance. Nice idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wham.cloudsmith.com/&quot;&gt;http://wham.cloudsmith.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wham.cloudsmith.com/whamgraph?repository=emtrane%2Fpuppet-repo&quot;&gt;http://wham.cloudsmith.com/whamgraph?repository=emtrane%2Fpuppet-repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 65 &amp;ndash; 1st April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Devopsdays event of the year kicks off tomorrow, and with it hopefully lots of events where people can get together in one place and talk to each other. What devops means to me has always been best exemplified by the people I&amp;rsquo;ve met and talked to at such events, and when people take a line (devops is a developer land grab, none of these people work with systems at scale) I encourage them to go along and get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super interesting post from someone working in community management, about the overlaps between her world and that of operations and devops. Some nice examples and parallels, and a subtle call to team up and make things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://venessapaech.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/devops-and-strategic-alliances/&quot;&gt;http://venessapaech.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/devops-and-strategic-alliances/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Days Austin is just around the corner (Monday 2nd and Tuesday 3rd of April in fact) and for those that can&amp;rsquo;t make it the organisers and sponsors have arranged for live video streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmc.com/videos/live/devopdays_austin2012.html&quot;&gt;http://www.bmc.com/videos/live/devopdays_austin2012.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of blog posts appeared this week summarising a recent mailing list thread. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting because it gets to what devops is, or at least what we as a community would like it to be perceived as. The line &amp;ldquo;For Devops to succeed we must focus on squishy stuff first, technical details second.&amp;rdquo; I wholeheartedly agree with, but know from putting this newsletter together each week it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find interesting content on tools and processes. More &amp;ldquo;squishy stuff&amp;rdquo; would definitely be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/DevopsPerceptions&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/DevopsPerceptions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spikelab.org/devops-notjust-configuration-management/&quot;&gt;http://www.spikelab.org/devops-notjust-configuration-management/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualising networks of nodes is interesting, until you get to so many nodes that all sense breaks down. It turns out this is called a hairball in some graph circles, and this blog post describes the problems and a few potential solutions. I&amp;rsquo;d certainly be interested in tools based on these ideas for infrastructure visualisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eagereyes.org/techniques/graphs-hairball&quot;&gt;http://eagereyes.org/techniques/graphs-hairball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice quick writeup of the custom file server that GitHub uses. Mainly interesting to see the different graphs used for monitoring an application of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1089-nodeload-metrics&quot;&gt;https://github.com/blog/1089-nodeload-metrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing operations goals in terms of developer and sprint friendly terminology definitely feels like a good idea, and this post lists some high level goals broken down into availability, performance, support, security and deployment. It would be nice to see these fleshed out with details and patterns for making them happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2012/03/28/service-delivery-best-practices/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2012/03/28/service-delivery-best-practices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops is still a very new movement/term and lots more people are finding it (and this newsletter) every week. For those in the position it&amp;rsquo;s worth a little history lesson about where this all started to coalesce into a thing &amp;ndash; and this blog post does that. The argument that three things, agile infrastructure, velocity and lean, came together is made nicely, and it&amp;rsquo;s a good read of those that wonder about such things and weren&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itrevolution.com/the-convergence-of-devops/&quot;&gt;http://itrevolution.com/the-convergence-of-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of 16 common unix monitoring utilities. The long time systems administrators reading will be more than familiar with these but those new to operations roles, especially coming from a development background, should find it interesting and a good list of tools to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://h30565.www3.hp.com/t5/Feature-Articles/16-Linux-Server-Monitoring-Commands-You-Really-Need-To-Know/ba-p/1936&quot;&gt;http://h30565.www3.hp.com/t5/Feature-Articles/16-Linux-Server-Monitoring-Commands-You-Really-Need-To-Know/ba-p/1936&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectacular looks like an interesting, and very quick, way of taking a look at SNMP data from your router. Just install the gem, point it at the router and you&amp;rsquo;ll get a nice browser based interface to watch traffic on the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tenderlove/spectacular&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tenderlove/spectacular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kibana is an alternative user interface for Logstash, the log aggregation and visualisation tool. It&amp;rsquo;s nicely documented with big pictures of the UI and some of the features like the trend analysis look particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rashidkpc.github.com/Kibana/about.html&quot;&gt;http://rashidkpc.github.com/Kibana/about.html&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 64 &amp;ndash; 25th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just back from Edinburgh after a fun and informative few days at PuppetCamp Edinburgh. Hi to all the folks who made it along. I got a chance to run through a talk on using the data buried inside your configuration management tool for things like reporting, eliminating multiple sources of truth and visualisation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/mining-puppet.&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/mining-puppet.&lt;/a&gt; Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people do appear to get confused over the term Devops. This post tries to cover some of those areas for confusion and address them one by one. Worth reading for when you wander into similar conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2012/03/13/what-is-devops-not/&quot;&gt;http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2012/03/13/what-is-devops-not/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did anyone mention that naming things is hard? This post from Adrian Cockcroft of Netflix is interesting for a number of reasons but I found the descriptions of how Netflix operate the most insightful. Some good comments and replies too. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in cloud operations at scale it&amp;rsquo;s worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://perfcap.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html&quot;&gt;http://perfcap.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Alspaw from Etsy responded with a long followup to the above post, going into some detail about the reasons why some folks don&amp;rsquo;t like the NoOps terminology. Again I found this more interesting for the insight about how Etsy work and organise themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2140086&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/2140086&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re developing code that will be distributed for multiple distributions then testing can be irritating. This post covers a neat way of testing Chef cookbooks across multiple distros using Vagrant &amp;ndash; by defining multiple virtual machines in the Vagrantfile. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple pattern, and one that would be useful for more than just configuration management testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/03/18/multivm-vagrantfile-for-chef/&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/03/18/multivm-vagrantfile-for-chef/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not often I come across interesting Windows content, partly because I don&amp;rsquo;t find myself using it very often. But whenever I do it&amp;rsquo;s nearly always something about powershell. This article covers a nice idea, using a script to generate a regular report of data from across a group of servers. Includes an example, the working code and a good walk through of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/building-a-daily-systems-report-email-with-powershell/&quot;&gt;http://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/building-a-daily-systems-report-email-with-powershell/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Food Fight podcast is back again and becoming more regular it seems. This episode goes into some detail about reusability of configuration management code and in particular applying good object orientated patterns to Chef recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/03/episode-6-cookbook-reusability-with.html&quot;&gt;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/03/episode-6-cookbook-reusability-with.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Puppet Camp this last week one of the talks, by Matt Carroll of Future Publishing was particularly interesting. These slides tell a good story of an evolving technical organisation and go into some details of how they came to love publish/subscribe tools via the use of mcollective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://oholiab.goatse.co.uk/puppetcamp.html&quot;&gt;http://oholiab.goatse.co.uk/puppetcamp.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skewer is another tool to make using Puppet without the central puppetmaster easier. It features integration with fog for creating EC2 and Rackspace Cloud instances, as well as a bootstrap to install Puppet&amp;rsquo;s dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to see lots of content around devops makes for a great excuse to try and spot patterns. Lots of previous articles and several this issue  are encouraging, lots of smart people seeking inspiration from other more mature fields. Definitely lots still to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article about some of the changes around moving to a public cloud. Good points that, for certain software stacks at least, the unlimited capacity available can be used to work around all sorts of problems but at a financial cost. The idea of a cost aware SLA is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ukelson.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/cloud-operations-1-the-frontal-lobe/&quot;&gt;http://ukelson.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/cloud-operations-1-the-frontal-lobe/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etsy have talked before about their desire to have new starters commit code to production on day one. This new post covers the internal infrastructure they have in place to let that happen safely. Interesting that they use a central virtualisation setup using KVM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brice Figureau continues his one-man effort to document the inner workings of puppet. This post in the series is about the compiler and how it transforms the details of the node and the code you write into a catalog to be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2012/03/17/puppet-internals-the-compiler/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2012/03/17/puppet-internals-the-compiler/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NoOps debate still rages but I&amp;rsquo;ve seen very few positive posts worth including. This one however makes a few good points on the topic. For a taster the post and comments include lines like &amp;ldquo;I don’t feel like it’s helping us define where we want to go&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;either you&amp;rsquo;re missing part of my point, or else we&amp;rsquo;re in violent agreement&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ingineering.it/post/19383804543/devops-vs-noops-misses-the-point&quot;&gt;http://blog.ingineering.it/post/19383804543/devops-vs-noops-misses-the-point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great slide desk on the similarities between devops and the workings of a Formula 1 racing team. Lots of good examples and points about things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/StephenBurton_WhatCanDevOpsLearnFromFormula1.pdf&quot;&gt;http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/StephenBurton_WhatCanDevOpsLearnFromFormula1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typesafe have released a console for there integrated scala, play and akka framework and it does look rather nice. The accompanying blog post covers some of the rationale any how certain features can be used to isolate production problems. The online is nice to explore too. I&amp;rsquo;d love to see an open source framework for building interactive dashboards like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.typesafe.com/introducing-typesafe-console&quot;&gt;http://blog.typesafe.com/introducing-typesafe-console&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://console-demo.typesafe.com/&quot;&gt;http://console-demo.typesafe.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the presentations that caught my eye from the recent Qcon was this one on ensuring resilient responses in complex systems. Lots of notes from academic literature and interesting looking books plus loads of real world examples and things you can do to make your applications more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/resilient-response-in-complex-systems&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/resilient-response-in-complex-systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nervous aims to provide the building blocks for building your own monitoring systems. It&amp;rsquo;s a node.js framework based around a simple plugin architecture and provides a simple way for sending data to Graphite too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gflarity/nervous&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gflarity/nervous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails default logging can be useful while developing applications but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty annoying when it comes to production applications. Lograge is an attempt to fix that, extracted from the Travis CI codebase. It takes the multiline logging and changes everything to one line per request.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 62 &amp;ndash; 11th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first story this week is the news of the 1.0 release of Vagrant. I just wanted to say a personal thank you to Mitchell and everyone else involved in the development and evangelism of a particularly useful part of mine, and many others, development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big release this last week, Vagrant has hit 1.0. This is an important release as the format for the Vagrantfile will now be supported for the foreseeable future. The recommended installation method has also changed, with native installers shipping for a large number of different platforms. Huge congratulations to Mitchell Hashimoto and everyone else involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vagrantup.com/?v1&quot;&gt;http://vagrantup.com/?v1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto, of Vagrant fame, has written a nice summary of 2 years hard work on open source software. Lots of good insights and advice for anyone involved or wanting to get involved in open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitchellhashimoto.com/post/18870472135/hardest-and-most-rewarding-job&quot;&gt;http://mitchellhashimoto.com/post/18870472135/hardest-and-most-rewarding-job&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good lucking presentation about a number of places where operations kills and awareness are particularly useful for developers. Lots of details about approaches to logging, metrics collection, java packaging and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/chids/p/the-ops-side-of-dev-2012-03-02&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/chids/p/the-ops-side-of-dev-2012-03-02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting description of the problem with making configuration management code reusable. I have to agree with the general theme, that this is no-where near a solved problem. Some good examples of how traditional object orientated software practices could be applied to the problem too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nistu.de/2012/03/04/reusability-in-configuration-management-systems/&quot;&gt;http://blog.nistu.de/2012/03/04/reusability-in-configuration-management-systems/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup from a talk by Gene Kim, author of Visible Ops. Nicely summarising devops, in particular the letters to stakeholders section which has bullet point advice for different groups; developers, testers, operations, designers and product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.williamhertling.com/2012/03/when-it-says-no-creating-fast-feature.html&quot;&gt;http://www.williamhertling.com/2012/03/when-it-says-no-creating-fast-feature.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing configuration management code is still in most places a new idea, with new tools and approaches still being worked out. This example I found interesting, it runs a command after a puppet run which runs a series of tests and emails failures. The tests themselves are defined as nagios checks and interestingly defined alongside your puppet resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example42.com/?q=TestingPuppetWithPuppi&quot;&gt;http://www.example42.com/?q=TestingPuppetWithPuppi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of the future of systems administration appears to be a recurring one, and this post makes a case for specialisation and in particular different types of admin. Makes some point about this being the case now in places and that other industries or shops will move in that direction over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2012/03/the-coming-future-of-system-administration/&quot;&gt;http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2012/03/the-coming-future-of-system-administration/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m seeing more and more tools being built around Graphite, which can only be a good thing. Response acts as a proxy for graphite, and features a plugin system to act on incoming data. The example alerting plugins look interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gflarity/response&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gflarity/response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard::Knife looks a handy tool which can automatically trigger knife commands when your Chef cookbook files change. Useful if you find yourself constantly saving and then uploading to your Chef server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nistude/guard-knife&quot;&gt;https://github.com/nistude/guard-knife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 61 &amp;ndash; 4th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick thank you to two tools instead of a proper introduction this week. Without Instapaper (for collecting links during the week whether I&amp;rsquo;m at a computer or from my phone) and without Mailchimp (for sorting all the subscriptions and sending the email) I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Devops Weekly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have got this far. So thanks to both services for being awesome. Right, on with the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s useful to have a list to start from when setting up or improving infrastructure. This list breaks down into provisioning, configuration management, deployment, orchestration, monitoring, log management, process supervision and security/auditing and briefly describes each. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this list at work I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ranjib.posterous.com/infrastructure-tooling-patterns&quot;&gt;http://ranjib.posterous.com/infrastructure-tooling-patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not new but it was recommended to me just last week, this free PDF book covers DNS in exacting detail (it comes in at 747 pages). Looks well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jpmens.net/2010/10/29/alternative-dns-servers-the-book-as-pdf/&quot;&gt;http://jpmens.net/2010/10/29/alternative-dns-servers-the-book-as-pdf/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly simple approach to backing up Jenkins configuration using git and cron. Easy to alter for whatever backup approach you use too, the secret is in the example .gitignore file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1919354&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/1919354&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup of one organisations adoption of devops ideas, in particular to help improve the quality and maintainability of deployed software. I think it&amp;rsquo;s missing a few things, in particular a push towards smaller and more regular deployments, and some mention that it&amp;rsquo;s not just pre-deployment that can benefit from cross team communication but the whole development process. But the detail is all interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/Using-DevOps-approaches-for-pre-release-and-production-software-quality&quot;&gt;http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/Using-DevOps-approaches-for-pre-release-and-production-software-quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services has lots of individual components, one of which that often seems to lead to misunderstandings is ELB, the load balancing service. This article from Amazon covers lots of technical details especially useful for anyone with experience of other load balancing technologies. It details the architecture as well as possible testing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1636185810492479&quot;&gt;http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1636185810492479&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good detailed post about a rigorous pursuit of speedy build and test runs. Lots of technical details specific to Java and JVM environments, but also lots of general principles about why and how to go about getting serious about build performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dan.bodar.com/2012/02/28/crazy-fast-build-times-or-when-10-seconds-starts-to-make-you-nervous/&quot;&gt;http://dan.bodar.com/2012/02/28/crazy-fast-build-times-or-when-10-seconds-starts-to-make-you-nervous/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logs are always interesting, and this post gives a brief overview of how different platform as a service offerings deal with them. In particular it details what logs are available from Engine Yard, including lots of links to posts about how you might go about analysing the contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://logentries.com/blog/2012/02/digging-into-engineyard-logs/&quot;&gt;https://logentries.com/blog/2012/02/digging-into-engineyard-logs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastically illustrated post about what it means to Netflix to be fault tolerant. The scale at which Netflix are operating is pretty extreme, but lots of the theory is applicable to smaller systems too. The break down of what to do from a user point of view when part of a distributed system fails is particularly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/fault-tolerance-in-high-volume.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/fault-tolerance-in-high-volume.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure how I&amp;rsquo;ve not come across Riemann until now. It&amp;rsquo;s billed as a networking monitoring system for distributed systems. It&amp;rsquo;s built to process streams of inputs, often sent from within applications over TCP or UDP. It can forward to graphite as well as email for specific events. More interesting are the protocol buffer based API and the example dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/&quot;&gt;http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aphyr/riemann&quot;&gt;https://github.com/aphyr/riemann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toft is similar to Vagrant in that it provides a simple set of command line tools for managing virtual machines. The difference is that it uses LXC containers rather than virtualbox, which does mean it only works on Linux but also means it&amp;rsquo;s very fast to start or destroy containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/exceedhl/toft&quot;&gt;https://github.com/exceedhl/toft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people have been experimenting with different ways of testing configuration management tools using virtual machines and this vagrant plugin attempts to make it easier to do so. Just define what tests you want to run in your vagrantfile and the plugin gives you a command to run both tests on the guest and on the host.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 60 &amp;ndash; 26th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weekend, and another devopsweekly issue filled with hopefully worthwhile articles and a few interesting tools. Do let me know what you think about the mix of content each week, or if you feel the email is missing anything in particular. Drop me a line at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#x67;&amp;#x61;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x74;&amp;#104;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#110;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x74;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x67;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x68;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#111;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x68;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#115;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x76;&amp;#x65;&amp;#110;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&lt;/a&gt; with any ideas you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Cafe is back this week with a new episode. John and Damon chat with Jordan Sissel about his work on fpm, logstash and more. Some good discussion in particular around the state of commercial and open source log management software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2012/2/25/devops-cafe-episode-22.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2012/2/25/devops-cafe-episode-22.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting writeup about running into a scaling issue with puppet and some of the complexities of a real world setup using puppet, passenger and apt-cache. Attempting to get everything to call in at the same time is tricky so some useful tips here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomoconnor.eu/blogish/puppet-apt-and-our-very-own-thundering-herd/&quot;&gt;http://tomoconnor.eu/blogish/puppet-apt-and-our-very-own-thundering-herd/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opscode, the nice folks behind Chef, have released their excellent training material under an open source license and put the content and code up on GitHub. Interesting writeup too of moving from Keynote to Markdown, and the ultimate goal of making the next session benefit from the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/02/23/open-source-training-materials/&quot;&gt;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/02/23/open-source-training-materials/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opscode/chef-fundamentals&quot;&gt;https://github.com/opscode/chef-fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good slide deck about mining all the data available from your infrastructure. Some nice examples of mapping metrics to configuration management tools and some ideas for dealing with graphs and logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/RanjibDey/spit-gather-churn-mining-infrastructure-data-for-ops-intelligence&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/RanjibDey/spit-gather-churn-mining-infrastructure-data-for-ops-intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to squeeze more performance out of your MySQL setup then this whitepaper from the Percona folk, MySQL Performance Analysis with Percona Toolkit and TCP/IP Network Traffic, might be of interest. Goes into lots of low level details if you&amp;rsquo;re at the point of optimising network level traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.percona.com/about-us/mysql-white-paper/mysql-performance-analysis-with-percona-toolkit-and-tcp-ip-network-traffic/&quot;&gt;http://www.percona.com/about-us/mysql-white-paper/mysql-performance-analysis-with-percona-toolkit-and-tcp-ip-network-traffic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot to include this last week so folks have probably seen it, but just in case. An excellent in-depth technical article about how Tumblr works. Covers a huge range of what software and hardware they use and why, along with some particularly interesting numbers and what they are doing now to solve specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/2/13/tumblr-architecture-15-billion-page-views-a-month-and-harder.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/2/13/tumblr-architecture-15-billion-page-views-a-month-and-harder.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the particularly interesting talks at FOSDEM was the wikipedia open source infrastructure talk. This writeup of the talk covers a lot of ground and picks a few of the particularly interesting success stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lwn.net/Articles/480002/&quot;&gt;http://lwn.net/Articles/480002/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix are making increasing use of Cassandra and are releasing various open source tools they&amp;rsquo;ve built to deal with a very large deployment. Priam looks particularly interesting, providing backup and recovery, bootstrapping and automated token assignment, centralized configuration management and interestingly a RESTful monitoring and metrics package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/announcing-priam.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/announcing-priam.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayfair, a Boston based 500 million dollar e-commerce company, is looking to grow our systems administration team by bringing on board talented individuals seeking broad exposure to the technologies that support our infrastructure and our large-scale Internet e-commerce platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wayfair.com/careers#dept=engineering&amp;amp;job=oGMQVfwX&quot;&gt;http://www.wayfair.com/careers#dept=engineering&amp;amp;job=oGMQVfwX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperdex is yet another key-value store, but it does appear to add an interesting feature to the mix, specifically optimisation for search and search primitives. The performance benchmarks look promising too, I&amp;rsquo;d certainly be interested in finding anyone running this in anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hyperdex.org/&quot;&gt;http://hyperdex.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amon is an interesting looking logging and exception tracking dashboard. It&amp;rsquo;s a Python and MongoDB application but ships with support for Rails, Django and Node.js apps and the screenshot at least makes it look pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 59 &amp;ndash; 19th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good week for discussion and debate this last week. In particular the Devops google group suddenly came to life with several worthwhile threads on job titles and organisation names, and whether networking knowledge is a key skill for everyone. If you&amp;rsquo;re not already subscribed then take a look &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/devops.&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/devops.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t generally include negative content but this Reddit thread has some interesting discussions hidden amongst. The original blog post appears to have disappeared, but what I find most interesting is some of the preconceived ideas about Devops. Knowing some of the arguments against makes making coherent arguments for easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pp860/why_i_hate_the_word_devops/&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pp860/why_i_hate_the_word_devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foodfight podcast is back with another episode, this one featuring some FOSDEM roundup, discussions with John E. Vincent and some Chef community news. Worth a listen even if you&amp;rsquo;re not using Chef as the content is broader than just a single tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/02/episode-3-usrbinruby-for-sysadmins-with.html&quot;&gt;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/02/episode-3-usrbinruby-for-sysadmins-with.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neat idea for versioning DNS records in Git. The example uses the dnsimple API, but you could do exactly the same with any good DNS provider with an API. Would be nice to see this automated, or maybe even a DNS vendor allow access to records as a git repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://support.dnsimple.com/discussions/suggestions/51-how-to-view-domain-record-diffs-in-git&quot;&gt;http://support.dnsimple.com/discussions/suggestions/51-how-to-view-domain-record-diffs-in-git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of talk recently about the use of the word Devops in job titles. This post makes a strong case that, used as a qualifier, it makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spikelab.org/devops-job-title/&quot;&gt;http://www.spikelab.org/devops-job-title/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This OASIS standards group are working on a Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications. The aims are portability and interoperable, but the tools being used are XML and large vendors. Depending on your interests it be worth reading through the existing specification for ideas and maybe how concepts are named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca&quot;&gt;http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting case study from Fotopedia focused on their use of MongoDB and MySQL. Mainly focuses on what they have learned moving some data from MySQL to Mongo, with details of why they did it and what they liked best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/17155176484/mongodb-vs-mysql-a-devops-point-of-view&quot;&gt;http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/17155176484/mongodb-vs-mysql-a-devops-point-of-view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice summary of #monitoring sucks, in response to the idea that it was really just some sort of marketing scheme. Lots of good related links here as well as details of why monitoring really does suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://solarce.org/2012/02/12/why-monitoring-sucks-or-the-future-is-a-toolbox/&quot;&gt;http://solarce.org/2012/02/12/why-monitoring-sucks-or-the-future-is-a-toolbox/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good article focusing on practices for low risk software releases. Covering canary releases, feature switching, approaches to minimising the need for rollbacks. Nothing new for those at the cutting edge, but a good place to start or to convince sceptical management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1833567&quot;&gt;http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1833567&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppet Labs continues to grow and are hiring both a Senior Professional Services Engineer and a Senior Sales Engineer to join our Technical Operations team. Senior Professional Services Engineers help our Puppet Labs' customers succeed through training, consulting, and custom development engagements, as well as further Puppet Labs product growth with direct customer feedback. Our new Senior Sales Engineer will act as technical evangelist by providing advanced technical pre-sales support, communicating the technical and business value proposition of Puppet Labs’ products for client engagements, and speaking at events. Please note, these two roles may be based anywhere in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/jobs&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely no information available at this stage but Devopsdays will be back in Europe in October again, this time it&amp;rsquo;s heading to Italy. The organisers are on the look out for anyone interested in helping out too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFT looks very interesting. The idea is pretty simple; a command line app which remembers the resulting actions of commands you type and allows you to export them as Puppet manifests. Potentially a nice easy way of learning Puppet syntax or generating simple manifests quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cft.et.redhat.com/&quot;&gt;http://cft.et.redhat.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t wanted a full size set of traffic lights wired up to their continuous integration server? Well here&amp;rsquo;s a nice project (including circuit diagrams, Arduino details and a small Ruby script that does just that. Where you get hold of the traffic lights I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johndavid400/Isotope11_traffic_lights&quot;&gt;https://github.com/johndavid400/Isotope11_traffic_lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 58 - 12th February 2012</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2012/02/12/issue-58/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 58 &amp;ndash; 12th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hopefully good set of blog posts this week, with many focused on people writing about their work infrastructure or stories about a particular incident. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just because I&amp;rsquo;ve become better at finding this sort of content, but it feels to me like hand in hand with the whole devops thing has come much more openness about infrastructure and how we build these networks and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent, detailed post about how to go about introducing a new programming language into an organisation. Having been involved in similar, though smaller, transitions this advice is well worth reading and I think is as relevant to systems administrators moving from just bash scripts as it is to developers moving from Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/01/lessons-learned-while-introducing-new.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/01/lessons-learned-while-introducing-new.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice to see a different take on some of the implications of continuous deployment, this post covers the case of paid for software, and the clash between continuous deployment and charging for a new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ayende.com/blog/154689/the-economics-of-continuous-deployment&quot;&gt;http://ayende.com/blog/154689/the-economics-of-continuous-deployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postmortem&amp;rsquo;s for incidents can be hugely beneficial both for avoiding future issues and for institutional learning. However this blog post argues against stressing the root cause, stating that for complex systems there often isn&amp;rsquo;t one single cause. Lots of interesting points and further academic reading for those particularly interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/02/10/each-necessary-but-only-jointly-sufficient/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/02/10/each-necessary-but-only-jointly-sufficient/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed stories from inside organisations are always interesting. This one describes the infrastructure setup at 99designs. I&amp;rsquo;d wager this is quite a typical setup so is probably a good read for folks who are just learning how to grow their small web application and maybe want to know what it might look like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://99designs.com/tech-blog/blog/2012/01/30/infrastructure-at-99designs/&quot;&gt;http://99designs.com/tech-blog/blog/2012/01/30/infrastructure-at-99designs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good story post, this about a particular event &amp;ndash; needing to scale up a small application very rapidly. It&amp;rsquo;s worth reading, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve not been involved in anything similar before. Integrating this sort of testing and working into your ongoing development process is important if you&amp;rsquo;re not going to run into a similar hard deadline too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.williamhertling.com/2012/02/scaling-web-app-1000x-in-3-days.html&quot;&gt;http://www.williamhertling.com/2012/02/scaling-web-app-1000x-in-3-days.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love hanging automation off Puppet&amp;rsquo;s stored configuration database, but deleting nodes in a highly dynamic environment can be irritating. This post and associated code shows one way of solving this problem in an OpenStack environment using the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://geek.jasonhancock.com/2012/02/06/removing-destroyed-cloudstack-instances-from-puppet-stored-configurations-db/&quot;&gt;http://geek.jasonhancock.com/2012/02/06/removing-destroyed-cloudstack-instances-from-puppet-stored-configurations-db/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a question left unanswered in one of the talks at FOSDEM and a bit of rapid hacking Puppet now has a new way of describing manifests: XML. I was genuinely going to do this for the April 1st issue too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unethicalblogger.com/2012/02/08/puppet-xml-a-brand-new-synergy.html&quot;&gt;http://unethicalblogger.com/2012/02/08/puppet-xml-a-brand-new-synergy.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtyler/puppet/tree/puppetxml&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rtyler/puppet/tree/puppetxml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After FOSDEM last weekend several people headed off to Antwerp for a monitoring themed hack day and workshop. Lots of whiteboarding ensued, as well as discussions of the increasing utility of logstash for  passing all the data around effectively. Sorry I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last a little self-promotion. At work as well as building a new development team inside the UK Government we&amp;rsquo;ve been building a culture of dashboards on large screens. I&amp;rsquo;m always interested to see other organisations dashboards and finally got round to a blog post about ours. If anyone else has similar pictures of posts I&amp;rsquo;d love to see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack appears to be picking up speed, case studies and fans pretty quickly. But having a play with your own personal cloud feels a little difficult. That&amp;rsquo;s where DevStack comes in. Good documentation and a series of scripts to get you setup with a local environment. It&amp;rsquo;s not intended for production deployments, more for development and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 57 &amp;ndash; 5th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weeks issue comes direct from FOSDEM. I&amp;rsquo;m currently chatting about monitoring and related perils with Patrick Debois, Mitchell Hashimoto and a bunch of other equally smart folks. The configuration management room has been interesting so far, and the cloud devroom yesterday had some interesting talks too. FOSDEM is definitely the place to be this weekend it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems administration is changing, and this post makes quite a strong argument that for many if not most sysadmins the future is about automation, configuration management and disposable virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/DevopsIsHereWhetherYouLikeItOrNot&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/DevopsIsHereWhetherYouLikeItOrNot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else I saw in a talk at FOSDEM this weekend, this online app lets you calculate or play around with the measure of availability for your system based on the mean time between failure and mean time to recovery values. A nice way of highlighting the importance of what needs to happen to improve availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/reliability_calculator/&quot;&gt;http://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/reliability_calculator/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather ominously titled post, but one that&amp;rsquo;s not as negative as it appears. I particularly like the focus on how the same words are often used to describe different things by different groups &amp;ldquo;would ops define an “application” in Puppet the same way dev would define an “application” in Hudson&amp;rdquo;? Without sharing terminology modelling dependencies across tools becomes much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skydingo.com/blog/2012/01/why-devops-is-doomed-ops-teams-are-lost-1-of-3/&quot;&gt;http://skydingo.com/blog/2012/01/why-devops-is-doomed-ops-teams-are-lost-1-of-3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zynga has a number of unusual requirements when it comes to managing it&amp;rsquo;s game servers. This post, although light on technical details, talks a little about how they are using ZooKeeper to make configuration changes across the entire fleet in under a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.zynga.com/2011/08/updating-thousands-of-configuration-files-in-under-a-second/&quot;&gt;http://code.zynga.com/2011/08/updating-thousands-of-configuration-files-in-under-a-second/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using continuous integration systems to do more than just run a test suite against your code is becoming more and more common, this example takes a web.config configuration file for a .NET project and runs a large number of security checks against it. This approach has a number of advantages, in particular meaning once you&amp;rsquo;ve fixed the highlighted issues they stay fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dotnet.dzone.com/articles/continuous-webconfig-security&quot;&gt;http://dotnet.dzone.com/articles/continuous-webconfig-security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s maybe too easy to think about Devops just in terms of devs and ops, and ignore all the other folks who are part of a well rounded product team. One group that often gets overlooked are the support folks, if any set of people can help bridge the communications gaps it&amp;rsquo;s good professional communicators. This post, from a former developer at Flickr, really gets that across &amp;ndash; in the form of a rant about why firing much of the support team is such a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nolancaudill.com/2012/01/30/the-front-line/&quot;&gt;http://nolancaudill.com/2012/01/30/the-front-line/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensu, the nice looking new monitoring framework, is picking up speed it seems. Describing Sensu as a &amp;ldquo;monitoring router&amp;rdquo; makes for a nice picture, this post covers integrating Sensu with Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joemiller.me/2012/02/02/sensu-and-graphite/&quot;&gt;http://joemiller.me/2012/02/02/sensu-and-graphite/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of NoOps cropped up again this week, and this post neatly summed up some of what I think, in particular it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;always Operations somewhere&amp;rdquo;. Operations is about running something and knowing how it works far more than it&amp;rsquo;s about specific tools and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraydon.co.uk/blog/2012/02/03/the-fallacy-of-noops/&quot;&gt;http://paulgraydon.co.uk/blog/2012/02/03/the-fallacy-of-noops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another follow up to the post about NoOps. This one really gets down to the problem with words and terminology. I think people really do want basically the same future, but trying to get into the debate with terms that actively exclude people is just poor marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spikelab.org/noops-good-idea-poor-wording-devops-paa/&quot;&gt;http://www.spikelab.org/noops-good-idea-poor-wording-devops-paa/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first devopsdays event is approaching, this one is being held in Austin, Texas on the 2nd and 3rd of April. They are still looking for sponsors and speakers so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested get in touch via the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-austin/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-austin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deltacloud appears to have been around for a while as it&amp;rsquo;s a full Apache project, but I only came across it yesterday in one of the talks at FOSDEM. It&amp;rsquo;s a Ruby web service that exposes a standard API for interacting with different cloud infrastructure providers like EC2, OpenStack and Rackspace. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple HTTP interface so you could just grab servers using curl, but the project also has a number of native client libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deltacloud.apache.org/&quot;&gt;http://deltacloud.apache.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new monitoring tool gathering some interest this week is Extremon. It appears early days (the code is just being made public on GitHub) but the aims and examples sound interesting. If anyone is at the #monitoringsucks hack day this week and gets a demo I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://extremon.org/?p=58&quot;&gt;https://extremon.org/?p=58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pas a certain number of projects the Jenkins dashboard can look quite busy. Jenkins features simple custom views but even this might not be enough on larger projects. Enter the View Job Filters plugins which provides a dizzying number of customisable options, some based both on the logged in user and the current state of various builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudbees.com/2012/01/controlling-what-you-see-with-view-job.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.cloudbees.com/2012/01/controlling-what-you-see-with-view-job.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 56 &amp;ndash; 29th January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little late shipped today I&amp;rsquo;m afraid and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll have missed some good content as I&amp;rsquo;ve been particularly busy this week. Next weekend I&amp;rsquo;ll be at FOSDEM, which either means a &amp;ldquo;live from Belgium&amp;rdquo; special edition, or another slight delay too. The good news though is with the configuration management and cloud dev rooms (and nice belgium beer) and I should find lots of good content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git is increasingly the source control tool of choice for many projects, and going from using it for person projects to using it in a team can be quite a jump, especially if coming from a simpler tool. This guide is quick, simple and features useful graphics to try get you over the hump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kentnguyen.com/development/visualized-git-practices-for-team/&quot;&gt;http://kentnguyen.com/development/visualized-git-practices-for-team/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudFoundry has a rather interesting new feature, namely the ability to span multiple cloud providers. Some details of how this works are covered in the announcement, along with some demos of it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/13481010615/multi-language-multi-framework-what-about-multi-cloud&quot;&gt;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/13481010615/multi-language-multi-framework-what-about-multi-cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning from others mistakes is nearly as good as learning from your own first hand, so this series looks interesting. Tales of database woe, first up issues with CHECKSUM and backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/database-administration/confessions-of-a-dba-my-worst-mistake/&quot;&gt;http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/database-administration/confessions-of-a-dba-my-worst-mistake/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m quite a Solr fan, so this article particularly interested me this week. Past a certain point index replication can become increasingly problematic, Etsy looked to solve this using BitTorrent as the distribution mechanism with some great results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/23/solr-bittorrent-index-replication/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/23/solr-bittorrent-index-replication/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s pursuit of speed is well known, this article covers some very low level TCP tweaks that might be useful to get that extra edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2012/01/lets-make-tcp-faster.html&quot;&gt;http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2012/01/lets-make-tcp-faster.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensu, the new monitoring framework, looked interesting when I first came across it. But this in-depth getting started article should make jumping in quickly possible. Lots of details of the commands needed to install and configure your first instance and writing your first check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joemiller.me/2012/01/19/getting-started-with-the-sensu-monitoring-framework/&quot;&gt;http://joemiller.me/2012/01/19/getting-started-with-the-sensu-monitoring-framework/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More examples of Jenkins being used for much more than continuous integration. The parallels between testing and monitoring have interested me for a while, and explains why Jenkins feature set makes using it as part of a monitoring setup easy. This post covers a simple check involving processes, databases and log files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/01/23/lowtech-monitoring-with-jenkins/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/01/23/lowtech-monitoring-with-jenkins/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some in the agile community continuous delivery, and especially continuous deployment, ring alarm bells. This well argued post covers why this might be, and places continuous delivery as a subset of more traditional agile practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kief.com/continuous_delivery/continuous_delivery_vs_agile.html&quot;&gt;http://kief.com/continuous_delivery/continuous_delivery_vs_agile.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub has grown large pretty quickly, and this talk covers some of the how. Refreshingly it focuses both on technical and people issues equally, and has worthwhile points on both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zachholman.com/talk/scaling-github&quot;&gt;http://zachholman.com/talk/scaling-github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of Chef should be looking forward to ChefConf, to be held May 15th-17th in San Francisco. A call for proposals is open too, until February 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chefconf.opscode.com/&quot;&gt;http://chefconf.opscode.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moncli looks like another interesting new take on the monitoring problem. Written in Python and based around a RabbitMQ message broker, it also features an interesting sounding compatibility layer for Nagios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smetj/Moncli&quot;&gt;https://github.com/smetj/Moncli&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 55 &amp;ndash; 22nd January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big welcome to all the new readers this week. In terms of subscriptions this last week has been just about the business since I started. Elsewhere I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing a definite increase in interest in this whole devops things. Hopefully that means even more interesting content to find and read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good thread on Reddit with members of the Mozilla web development team discussing the approach they have taken to deployment and testing. Covers a lot of continuous delivery ground, but with some interesting first hand experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/oonrg/iama_member_of_the_mozilla_webdev_team_ama/c3iufax&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/oonrg/iama_member_of_the_mozilla_webdev_team_ama/c3iufax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the configuration and systems management devroom at Fosdem are now up, and I&amp;rsquo;m already looking forward to lots of these talks. Talks covering new tools (Rudder), old tools (Jenkins) and some devops culture (DevOps is not an absolute. It&amp;rsquo;s a range.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/configuration_and_systems_management_devroom&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/configuration_and_systems_management_devroom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon launched a new part of their web services stack this week, with Amazon DynamoDB. They describe is as a fast and scalable NoSQL database service and it&amp;rsquo;s a fully managed service. The free tier should see people experimenting with this at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/01/amazon-dynamodb.html&quot;&gt;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/01/amazon-dynamodb.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting post about running Puppet without the master. It outlines concerns for certain setups with having a master and goes over how they dealt with things like stored configuration in a masterless setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://current.workingdirectory.net/posts/2011/puppet-without-masters/&quot;&gt;http://current.workingdirectory.net/posts/2011/puppet-without-masters/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well thought through post with a catchy title about how system administration is changing profoundly and rapidly. I particularly like this quote as I think it&amp;rsquo;s hopefully an increasingly common sentiment &amp;ldquo;But it’s finally dawned on me that “devops” isn’t just some buzzword concept that someone has thought up to make sysadmins’ lives hell. It’s the natural evolution of both professions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantasic presentation by Mike Brittain about the development of a performance culture at Etsy. It features just enough graphs to give you ideas and talks about the technical, business and people sides of how they made improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain/web-performance-culture-and-tools-at-etsy-11159635&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain/web-performance-culture-and-tools-at-etsy-11159635&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FreeAgent, online accounting pioneers helping freelancers and small businesses worldwide, are looking for a talented Operations Engineer to bridge the gap between product development and infrastructure and to scale their web app to handle hundreds of thousands of incredibly happy customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLOSS UK&amp;rsquo;s annual Large Installation Systems Administration (LISA) conference is coming up soon, in Edinburgh from the 20th to the 22nd March. They are still on the lookout for talks as well if you have any good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flossuk.org/Events/Spring2012&quot;&gt;http://www.flossuk.org/Events/Spring2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is gearing up for the big 1.0 release, with version 0.9 shipped this last week. Lots of things in this release, including support for bridged networks, huge windows improvements and support for multiple versions of virtual box. The Vagrantfile syntax has changed a little however, but on first run you should be told what you need to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vagrantup.com/docs/changes/changes_08x_09x.html&quot;&gt;http://vagrantup.com/docs/changes/changes_08x_09x.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very nice looking simple load testing tool. Rather than cover the same ground as everyone else it&amp;rsquo;s one real feature is a way to visualise the resulting concurrent request success and failure rate. Beautifully simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewvc/parbench&quot;&gt;https://github.com/andrewvc/parbench&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(R?)ex is a Perl based remote command execution engine. The site has lots of nice examples and clear documentation, from a quick look it feels a lot like Fabric in Python. Might be useful, in particular if you&amp;rsquo;re happier with Perl than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very glad the growing devops community seems largely to be made up of people with an open source ethic. Even more than usual over the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve found my time saved by finding a useful library on Github and in more than one case pull requests have been sent and speedily accepted. I just wanted to say thank you to anyone maintaining a useful library or application before getting on with the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been describing Jenkins as an automation framework as much as a continuous integration system. So it&amp;rsquo;s good to read about others having success doing the same. Some good examples and discussion of when this is a good idea and when it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://morgajel.net/2011/12/12/1108&quot;&gt;http://morgajel.net/2011/12/12/1108&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just out today so I&amp;rsquo;ve not had a chance to listen yet, here&amp;rsquo;s episode 1 of a new community podcast all about Chef. Good luck to the folks behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick fire series of articles focusing on the effect of latency on monitoring. It talks about why latency is a problem, how you might architect a system to avoid the problems and then onto a nicely worked example with lots of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/01/09/monitoring-sucks-latency-sucks-more/&quot;&gt;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/01/09/monitoring-sucks-latency-sucks-more/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a few weeks to go until FOSDEM and some of the tracks have started publishing schedules. The configuration management devroom isn&amp;rsquo;t up yet, but the Development track has a devops flavoured talk and the virtualization and cloud devroom should be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/virtualization_and_cloud_devroom&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/virtualization_and_cloud_devroom&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/event/dev_to_devops&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/event/dev_to_devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ever tried to convince management that something is the way to do this post is worth reading. It&amp;rsquo;s both a description, and a note sent to Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s management about how Flickr achieved a good balance between speed and availability. In particular it stresses the importance that everyone owns availability, not just an operations team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/01/05/convincing-management-that-cooperation-and-collaboration-was-worth-it/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/01/05/convincing-management-that-cooperation-and-collaboration-was-worth-it/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;devops&amp;rdquo; might still be relatively new, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean lots of relevant research and writing doesn&amp;rsquo;t already exist. The collaboration aspect and wide scope of the domain can feel vague to some, Patrick here argues that&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s a so called wicked problem. Some great resources linked from this post in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/08/devops-a-wicked-problem/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/08/devops-a-wicked-problem/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post features a nice walk through the of main components in a large Java continuous delivery setup. Covers the virtualization platform, configuration management, load balancing, application server and deployment tools used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.xebia.com/2011/12/14/continuous-delivery-for-enterprise-java-applications/&quot;&gt;http://blog.xebia.com/2011/12/14/continuous-delivery-for-enterprise-java-applications/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automating DNS management is fun, and becoming increasingly easy with nice new DNS providers often publishing well designed web friendly APIs. This post features lots of examples using DNSimple, Ruby and Chef, but even if you&amp;rsquo;re using a different stack it&amp;rsquo;s still worth reading just for ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/01/02/switching-to-dnsimple/&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/01/02/switching-to-dnsimple/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of Puppercamp events coming up in the first half of this year. Dates for Atalanta, Edinburgh and Stockholm have already been announced and details of some of the sessions in Atlanta on the 3rd of February are already available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/atlantapuppetcamp/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/atlantapuppetcamp/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-camp/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-camp/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molog is another take on what to do with logs. It integrates heavily with logstash (for getting hold of logs) and nagios (for monitoring and altering). The command line tool for querying state looks useful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smetj.net/wiki/Molog_documentation&quot;&gt;http://www.smetj.net/wiki/Molog_documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself scraping the HTML from Nagios this last week to make a very quick dashboard. It&amp;rsquo;s not like it&amp;rsquo;s changed in the last 10 years so I reasoned it would be pretty stable. Then I came across Nagiosharder, a Ruby API build completely around a scraper, that exposes lots of the most common Nagios features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/railsmachine/nagiosharder&quot;&gt;https://github.com/railsmachine/nagiosharder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of both Git and code reviews, but at times some of the code review tools can feel quite heavy wight. So for me Reviewthis looks excellent. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple sinatra app you can run for free on Heroku and which lets you ask for reviews as part of commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/supermatter/reviewthis&quot;&gt;https://github.com/supermatter/reviewthis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2012-01-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 53 &amp;ndash; 8th January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some big news this week for devopsweekly &amp;ndash; I now have a sponsor. All
that really means to you the reader is you&amp;rsquo;ll get a short sponsors
message at the top of each edition which I&amp;rsquo;m hoping you&amp;rsquo;ll find useful.
Say a huge thanks to the nice folks at Brightbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service,
is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely article about the tool building ecosystem at Etsy. The examples
given also look fantastic, I&amp;rsquo;m sure anyone using Solr in anger will be
thinking about how they can get something like the Etsy query analyser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/04/the-product-hacking-ecosystem/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/04/the-product-hacking-ecosystem/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another fantastic article about how Netflix organise their teams of
developers and operations folks. Some great take aways from the notes,
including negative opinions about &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo; teams and some ideas
about structuring multiple teams in an engineering organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-netflix-gets-out-of-way-of.html&quot;&gt;http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-netflix-gets-out-of-way-of.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts about what one user would like to see in the Chef
ecosystem this year. Some discussions well worth having, including
packaging cookbooks, driving wider Ruby support and the best ways to
test of cookbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/01/chef-in-2012.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/01/chef-in-2012.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An argument against a mad dash towards using the latest tools and a call
for more writing and discussion about the processes and techniques used
by different organisations. I&amp;rsquo;d definitely agree from the point of view
of compiling this newsletter it&amp;rsquo;s easier to find content focused only on
tooling, the Etsy and Netflix posts above being great exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/we-have-the-tools-but-what-about-the-techniques/&quot;&gt;http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/we-have-the-tools-but-what-about-the-techniques/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good writeup of various monitoring tools and ways in which you might
integrate them. Covers getting data in and out of lots of tools
including graphite, ganglia, cumin, cacti and more. A separate post goes
into more detail about Nagios &amp;ldquo;Controlling the tool everybody hates, but
still uses&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-metrics-api-gateways/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-metrics-api-gateways/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editors Note: I nearly didn&amp;rsquo;t include this next post because someone is
going to suggest it&amp;rsquo;s only here because of the sponsorship. It&amp;rsquo;s the
opposite. One of the reasons I agreed to have Brightbox sponsor was that
they build interesting tools and write about them online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the Riak handbook over the holidays I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to
set up a cluster to play with, and this article covers how to do so
pretty simply. The instructions are for Brightbox cloud but you can
easily extract the Riak specific commands if you&amp;rsquo;re hosted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.brightbox.com/guides/cli/riak-cluster/&quot;&gt;http://docs.brightbox.com/guides/cli/riak-cluster/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After FOSDEM, on the 6th and 7th of February, a few people are gathering
under the #monitoringsucks umbrella for a hack day. If you can get to
Antwerp then it should be an interesting few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/monitoringsucks-and-well-fix-it&quot;&gt;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/monitoringsucks-and-well-fix-it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Rackspace have open sourced Dreadnot, an in-house tool for
continuous deployment. It looks to be doing some interesting things with
regards multi-region deployments and the discussion of their experiences
with Etsy&amp;rsquo;s deployinator are worth reading too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/blog/2012/01/05/rackspace-open-sources-dreadnot/&quot;&gt;http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/blog/2012/01/05/rackspace-open-sources-dreadnot/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/racker/dreadnot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/racker/dreadnot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting looking project to collect common utility scripts for
Jenkins. At the moment it contains only a few groovy scripts for the
script console for purging old data, but the idea is it should contain
all sorts of useful code to help manage jenkins. I&amp;rsquo;d encourage anyone
with scripts they already use to think about sending a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-scripts&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foodcritica is a nice looking lint tool for your Opscode Chef cookbooks.
It covers 18 rules so far from some LWRP checks to checking for the
correct metadata. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be integrated with a continuous
integration system as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/&quot;&gt;http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty comprehensive looking Puppet module for managing the
installation and configuration of a Jenkins instance. It covers the
installation of Jenkins plugins as well which is particularly handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unethicalblogger.com/2011/12/28/jenkins-with-puppet.html&quot;&gt;http://unethicalblogger.com/2011/12/28/jenkins-with-puppet.html&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 52 &amp;ndash; 1st January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A happy new year to everyone, here&amp;rsquo;s hoping 2012 will be just as productive on the devops front as 2011. The advantage of not sending anything last week is that this issue is overflowing with interesting content. It looks like at least a few folks have taken the time away from work to hack or write so thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extensive series of blog posts about implementing a continuous deployment setup in a .NET environment. Lots of screenshots. Lots of code examples. Lots of discussion about the tools used and what worked and what didn&amp;rsquo;t. Worth reading whether you&amp;rsquo;re using ASP.NET or not as most of it is application to any setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli&quot;&gt;http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s_Continuous_Delivery_Project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing the importance of cross functional teams can be difficult, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to push back on or water down. This post on the Continuous Delivery blog says to organize software delivery around outcomes, not roles. It&amp;rsquo;s a good read and probably a good article to pass on to management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://continuousdelivery.com/2011/12/organize-software-delivery-around-outcomes-not-roles/&quot;&gt;http://continuousdelivery.com/2011/12/organize-software-delivery-around-outcomes-not-roles/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opscode Community Summit looked like excellent fun (so it&amp;rsquo;s good to hear that it was the first of many). 40 sessions over 2 days generated lots of discussion, and nicely lots of those sessions have been written up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+Community+Summit+1&quot;&gt;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+Community+Summit+1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuring MySQL can be something of a black art. This excellent questionnaire based online application from Percona aims to make anyone with a web browser able to generate a sensible configuration for their particular setup. Very slick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.percona.com/&quot;&gt;http://tools.percona.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered which EC2 region to use for a particular geographical area? Well this open source project is doing interesting things to try and find out based on proximity and bandwidth availability. Interesting visualisations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/aws-datacenters&quot;&gt;http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/aws-datacenters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next release of Jenkins (1.446) has a very interesting looking feature slated for inclusion, namely exposing parts of the command line interface over a randomly assigned SSH interface. This should make it easier to automate Jenkins without carrying around the Java based command line interface library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+SSH&quot;&gt;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+SSH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest release of Graylog2, the excellent log management tool, has made a big change to it&amp;rsquo;s architecture and added a number of interesting looking features. Messages are now stored in ElasticSearch, allowing for faster queries against very large datasets. Aggregate statistics are stored elsewhere allowing for much faster graph generation and much longer term analytics. And the new browser based query shell looks good too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://graylog2.org/ohai/0.9.6&quot;&gt;http://graylog2.org/ohai/0.9.6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holidays might be nearly over but everyone always has time for more reading. Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of books, articles and papers to get you started in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/22/holiday-reading-list.html&quot;&gt;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/22/holiday-reading-list.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heals of the excellent puppet extensions series comes the start of a series on Puppet internals. This first part covers the Puppet Parser in quite some detail. Lots of code, good diagrams. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in working on Puppet itself or just seeing the insides of an interesting piece of software this is worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/12/27/puppet-internals-the-parser/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/12/27/puppet-internals-the-parser/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualision is always fun and potentially incredibly useful. This excellent blog post looks at an approach to visualising load across a large number of devices in such a way as to allow people to spot patterns. The break down of the problem and then working up the solution is excellent, and the end results very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2011/12/18/visualizing-device-utilization/&quot;&gt;http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2011/12/18/visualizing-device-utilization/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logs are an important part of knowing what is going on with our applications. This article argues that the sheer volume of lots means that log formats optimised for people are flawed, and more structured data optimised for machines is the better approach &amp;ndash; specifically that JSON is perfect. Lots of examples, code and a well worked argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2011/12/26/log-for-machines-in-json/&quot;&gt;http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2011/12/26/log-for-machines-in-json/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FnordMetric describes itself as a realtime app/event tracking thing based on ruby eventmachine and redis. The screenshots look great and give you an idea of what&amp;rsquo;s possible, and the documentation is extensive and includes lots of code samples. The todo list is also nothing if not ambitious, hopefully one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered which of your puppet resources was taking all that time? This very handy utility will give you a list of the slowest performing resources allowing you to optimise where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-profiler&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-profiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick shell script to build native packages (using fpm) of a list of gems. Specifically designed for use as a Jenkins jobs to automatically build the package when new ones are added. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to see how they are (automatically?) published to the yum repository mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrisBuytaert/build-gems&quot;&gt;https://github.com/KrisBuytaert/build-gems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite has lots of fans, but it seems not everyone is smitten with the web interface. Graphiti is a Ruby, Javascript and Redis based application that provides an alternative dashboard with some nice features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paperlesspost/graphiti&quot;&gt;https://github.com/paperlesspost/graphiti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a love/hate relationship with Nagios, and anything that makes automation easier has to be a good thing. This project provides a Ruby API client for the Livestatus Nagios plugin. It could do with more worked examples and better documentation but it looks an interesting and powerful approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zenops/livestatus&quot;&gt;https://github.com/zenops/livestatus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heals of releasing the Hubot Campfire bot the folks at GitHub have released the tools they use to control a Jenkins continuous integration server via the same bot. It&amp;rsquo;s designed for easy installation to Heroku so quick to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 51 &amp;ndash; 18th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the bad news, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take next weekend off so the next issue won&amp;rsquo;t be for two whole weeks. The good news is I have a bumper Christmas edition this week, which should hopefully keep everyone going until the new year. I&amp;rsquo;ve not been keeping track but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this is the most content I&amp;rsquo;ve included so far, and hopefully their will be something for everyone. Thanks again to all the authors of articles, covers of talks and hackers of code that make devopsweekly good fun to put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone interested or already using Riak should buy themselves an early Christmas present. Mathias Meyer has been writing furiously and has just shipped the self published Riak Handbook. It&amp;rsquo;s available as a bundle of Epub, Mobi and PDF. Importantly it covers not just using Riak, but also running it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://riakhandbook.com/&quot;&gt;http://riakhandbook.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the articles I include tend to be about learning new interesting things. This one is more of a warning &amp;ndash; at some point soon the Sun Java packages are going to disappear from the Ubuntu partner repositories due to Oracle licensing changes. If someone finds a good article about the best thing to do if this affects you let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html&quot;&gt;https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good article with a few opinions about the state of log management. Mentioned logstash and graylog2. Interesting points about the initial fear of new moving parts and complexity being mitigated by the usefulness of the resulting setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redbluemagenta.com/2011/08/19/modern-log-management-and-monitoring/&quot;&gt;http://redbluemagenta.com/2011/08/19/modern-log-management-and-monitoring/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of talk, and writing, about testing configuration management this week.  Nikolay Sturm, author of Cucumber-puppet, has created an example project demonstrating that tools usage. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to follow and makes a good template if you&amp;rsquo;re starting to write features for your manifests and modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nistu.de/2011/12/11/an-example-project-using-cucumber-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://blog.nistu.de/2011/12/11/an-example-project-using-cucumber-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabric is great for ad-hoc remote command execution, but that means it doesn&amp;rsquo;t ship with higher level abstractions that make common tasks just a matter of configuration. The discussion in this issue sounds interesting, a canonical source for useful snippets and higher level commands is in the works. For the moment the list of existing supporting tools is worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/461&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/461&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third article in a good series of posts about extending Puppet. This one particularly caught the eye as it covers what the Indirector is. If you&amp;rsquo;ve delved into Puppet source recently then you&amp;rsquo;ll have come across this and if you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me taken a bit of time to get your head around. This post solves that problem for future visitors to the Puppet code very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/12/11/the-indirector-puppet-extensions-points-3/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/12/11/the-indirector-puppet-extensions-points-3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good talk from Luke Kaines (creator of Puppet) at LISA. Starting with a good list of what Devops isn&amp;rsquo;t and then going on to the rapid changes in web operations. Also breaks down the agile manifesto in terms of systems administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxBEEh4Nsnk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxBEEh4Nsnk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another talk from LISA, this time from Jesse Robins of Opscode explaining the concept of a Gameday. I particularly love the quote &amp;ldquo;failure free operations require experience with failure&amp;rdquo;. Lots of other good takeaways in the slides too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jesserobbins/ameday-creating-resiliency-through-destruction&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jesserobbins/ameday-creating-resiliency-through-destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big conferences certainly make my life easier when looking for great content :) The last of this weeks LISA talks, this one the keynote given by Ben Rockwood. A pretty high level and convincing argument for Devops, painting it as a journey of discovery and not the final destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.usenix.org/2011/12/08/lisa-11-keynote-the-devops-transformation/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.usenix.org/2011/12/08/lisa-11-keynote-the-devops-transformation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice slide deck summarising Infrastructure as Code. Particular good for the diagrams used to explain the different parts of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/guttertec/infrastructure-as-code-10499271&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/guttertec/infrastructure-as-code-10499271&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent hashing is magic. This article explains how it works and why you should care. If you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with improving the availability of data intensive applications then this is a must read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/9/the-magic-of-consistent-hashing.html&quot;&gt;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/9/the-magic-of-consistent-hashing.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sysadvent has kept up the high quality posts, this one particularly caught my eye. Everyone has logs that they&amp;rsquo;d love to analyse, this post shows how to do so relatively simply using Elastic Map Reduce (Hadoop on EC2) and the Pig query language. Good getting started post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-10-analyzing-logs-with-pig-and.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-10-analyzing-logs-with-pig-and.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Patrick Debois Show&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone obviously put something in the water in Gent over the last week or so, as Patrick started churning out new and interesting content on a nearly daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post reprints an article written for the Usenix Login magazine, entitled Devops from a sysadmin perspective. It takes the familiar topics of culture, automation, measurement and sharing and breaks things down purely from the perspective of the working systems administrator. A good read if you&amp;rsquo;re skeptical and thinking devops is a bunch of developers trying to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/07/devops-from-a-sysadmin-perspective/&quot;&gt;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/07/devops-from-a-sysadmin-perspective/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier the topic of testing configuration management came up a few times this week, and this post is one of the very few around on the topic. It covers using Cucumber-puppet, Rspec-puppet and puppet-lint to introduce some useful tests to your puppet code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/05/puppet-unit-testing-like-a-pro/&quot;&gt;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/05/puppet-unit-testing-like-a-pro/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of how the above tools might work in a real project, this github repo sets up vagrant and guard (a ruby library using inotify) to automatically run your puppet manifests against a virtual machine as you edit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jedi4ever/vagrant-guard-demo&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jedi4ever/vagrant-guard-demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another little trick, this time for writing cucumber steps that can be more easily run across different systems using a couple of environment variables. The features are also worth having a look at if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in using cucumber and the aruba provided steps for testing command output and exit codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/15/bdd-testing-with-vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/15/bdd-testing-with-vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1476703&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/1476703&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rack-statsd is a number of pieces of Rack middleware for monitoring Ruby applications. Contains three middleware components extracted from GitHub for adding a health check URL, adding hostnames and git hashes as headers and sending unicorn process information to statsd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/rack-statsd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/github/rack-statsd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building system packages can mean having access to lots of different architectures. Local virtual machines can help here, and this project shows a nice way forward. It provides a vagrant setup and puppet modules to both install build dependencies and to compile and build rpm packages on the resulting virtual machine. Nice idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/roidelapluie/vagrant-build-mapnik&quot;&gt;https://github.com/roidelapluie/vagrant-build-mapnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 50 - 11th December 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/12/11/issue-50/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 50 &amp;ndash; 11th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week was a little short, mainly because I&amp;rsquo;d been pretty busy of late. This week I spent a bit more time looking and reading, so hopefully this issue should keep everyone busy until next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of message based systems and this article is an excellent starting point if you&amp;rsquo;re not that familiar with some of the terminology and general patterns. It covers what, why and some simple how examples. CoilMQ mentioned in the post also looks excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/12/11/common-messaging-patterns-using-stomp.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/12/11/common-messaging-patterns-using-stomp.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re the kind of person who prefers videos to long introductions, this presentation also covers message based architecture. It focuses a little on doing so with Sprint and discusses AMQP rather than stomp but it&amp;rsquo;s still makes a good introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Messaging-for-Modern-Applications&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Messaging-for-Modern-Applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next post asserts that &amp;ldquo;Devops has made Release and Deployment Cool&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d argue that it&amp;rsquo;s always been cool but that might just have been me :) The devops banner has certainly raised the awareness and level of debate between different parties about release automation. The brief discussion about the good and bad points about vendor involvement are also well put.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/12/devops-has-made-release-and-deployment.html&quot;&gt;http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/12/devops-has-made-release-and-deployment.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flume project, for collecting and aggregating log files, is looking at re-architecting how it works based on real world usage. Flume NG is the working title and this post discusses the upcoming plans for change. Interesting if you&amp;rsquo;re using Flume or if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reliable distributed systems design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.apache.org/flume/entry/flume_ng_architecture&quot;&gt;https://blogs.apache.org/flume/entry/flume_ng_architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of experiences from other sectors and approaches can be brought to bear on devops related problems. This post covers various Lean Manufacturing examples and in particular value stream mapping and applies them to web operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/12/5/companies-have-plenty-of-monitoring-what-they-dont-have-is-c.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/12/5/companies-have-plenty-of-monitoring-what-they-dont-have-is-c.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting log data in a manner that makes it easy to analyse can be tricky. This article covers using Fluentd to take apache logs and push them into a mongodb database with a minimum of configuration. Fluentd supports lots of different backends too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.treasure-data.com/post/13766262632/real-time-log-collection-with-fluentd-and-mongodb&quot;&gt;http://blog.treasure-data.com/post/13766262632/real-time-log-collection-with-fluentd-and-mongodb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent detailed post on the difference between Puppet&amp;rsquo;s parameterized classes and definitions. Done via relatively straightforward examples showing the differences and when to use both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigdunn.org/2011/09/puppet-parameterized-classes-vs-definitions/&quot;&gt;http://www.craigdunn.org/2011/09/puppet-parameterized-classes-vs-definitions/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice interview from Goto Conference with the authors of Continuous Delivery. It covers various strategies and patterns for testing, building and releasing software, and how these fit in with agile and lean software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devnology.nl/en/podcast/10-content/181-devnology-podcast-023-continuous-delivery&quot;&gt;http://devnology.nl/en/podcast/10-content/181-devnology-podcast-023-continuous-delivery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice infrastructure as code presentation introducing Chef for both managing server software and then going onto using Chef for deployment. Another presentation from GOTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Chef-in-the-Cloud-and-On-the-Ground&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Chef-in-the-Cloud-and-On-the-Ground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love what Puppet is doing and want to be a part of it? Puppet Labs, creators of Puppet, is growing, and are currently hiring for Professional Services Engineer (OR, NYC, UK), Operations Engineer (OR), Technical Training Manager (OR) and Account Manager (OR). Interested or know someone who might be? Check out our job postings (and apply online)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/jobs&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Librarian is a tool to resolve recursively a set of specifications and fetch and install the fully resolved specifications, in particular it provides a way of a managing a repository of Chef cookbooks. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with something like bundler in ruby or the requirements.txt file from pip in python then it&amp;rsquo;s something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian&quot;&gt;https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foodcritic looks like an excellent lint tool for Chef cookbooks. It only has a small number of (useful) checks at present but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to add more if you have a particular pattern you want to enforce or quash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic&quot;&gt;https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/&quot;&gt;http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the dependency on Node.js put you off the GitHub Hubot campfire bot, then this might be exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re after. This &amp;lsquo;fork&amp;rsquo; is written entirely in bash, with plugins being any arbitrary executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/teddziuba/hubot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/teddziuba/hubot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of organisations running large server clusters seem to be using or experimenting with bittorrent for distribution of code deploys. This project from Hyves is interesting mainly because of the details around making sure nodes in a given rack don&amp;rsquo;t all swamp the available uplink bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hyves-org/p2ptracker&quot;&gt;https://github.com/hyves-org/p2ptracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 49 &amp;ndash; 4th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s December again which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for Sysadvent. Curated by Jordan Sissel, this advent calendar style blog brings a new post every day from a range of guest authors. Hats off to Jordan on this, at least with the newsletter I only have to put things together once a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned Sysadvent is back, with four blog posts for far, and one per day throughout December. So far we&amp;rsquo;ve had bash tips, java deployment ideas, simple examples of web tools for letting other people run code and an introduction to packaging systems. All well worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-1-dont-bash-your-process-outputs.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-1-dont-bash-your-process-outputs.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-2-strategies-for-java-deployment.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-2-strategies-for-java-deployment.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-3-share-skills-and-permissions-with.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-3-share-skills-and-permissions-with.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-4-guide-to-packaging-systems.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-4-guide-to-packaging-systems.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-ups of an organisations entire stack are always interesting, this one is from Instagram who have quite the fleet of instances on EC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of&quot;&gt;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has tried to setup a continuous integration system to test across a range of different browsers already knows it&amp;rsquo;s not the easiest thing to maintain. If you&amp;rsquo;re now running on Windows already then you probably need some Windows machines too. This article covers doing just that in EC2, and features code to both start instances and run the tests on the windows hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.picklive.com/2011/12/02/continuous-integration-for-internet-explorer.html&quot;&gt;http://tech.picklive.com/2011/12/02/continuous-integration-for-internet-explorer.html&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a bit of time tweaking Varnish configurations this week and came across this article, which is worth reading mainly for the example vcl configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lullabot.com/articles/varnish-multiple-web-servers-drupal&quot;&gt;http://www.lullabot.com/articles/varnish-multiple-web-servers-drupal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting post positing that &amp;ldquo;Devops is the missing link between Agile/Extreme Programming and lean management&amp;rdquo;, coming from a large company Chief Information Officer it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how the idea is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://informationsystemsbiology.blogspot.com/2011/11/lean-it-devops-and-cloud-programming.html&quot;&gt;http://informationsystemsbiology.blogspot.com/2011/11/lean-it-devops-and-cloud-programming.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a number of Python or Django applications, or you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how a platform as a service operates under the hood, you might want to take a look at Djangy which has recently been open sourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dpaola2/djangy&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dpaola2/djangy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequencer is &amp;ldquo;an engine used by system administrators for the computation and execution of sequences of actions over hardware or software&amp;rdquo;. The examples make things a little clearer, if you&amp;rsquo;re running a physical data centre and need to software to power on/off computers, disk arrays, switches ad the like this might be of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pv-bull.github.com/sequencer/&quot;&gt;http://pv-bull.github.com/sequencer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a thing for yet more process supervision tools, Nanny might be of interest. It&amp;rsquo;s been developed by the folks behind Freebase and looks to have a few nice features including an In-built HTTP server for logs and statistics with both humanly-readable and machine-readable JSON output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/metaweb-nanny/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/metaweb-nanny/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 48 &amp;ndash; 27th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first issue of this newsletter went out just about 1 year ago this weekend to 476 people. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I started that if I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be sending one a year later to over 2000 folks, so thanks to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s stuck around or signed up since. With that in mind I&amp;rsquo;ve finally updated the archive to include all the recent issues too &lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsweekly.com/archive&quot;&gt;http://devopsweekly.com/archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration management devroom at FOSDEM in Belgium is back for a second year, and the call for papers is open. You have until the 31st of December to get proposals in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.puppetlabs.com/&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.puppetlabs.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short interview with Ben Rockwood, who&amp;rsquo;s going to be talking at LISA’11 next month on The Devops Transformation. Quick answers to questions, but it&amp;rsquo;s good to see in a traditional systems administration setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.usenix.org/2011/11/15/ben-rockwood-interview/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.usenix.org/2011/11/15/ben-rockwood-interview/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are talking about what monitoring could look like in the future, and this great diagram tries to map out the different components involved and some of the existing software used for the job. Very useful if you&amp;rsquo;re starting to think about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/vj83geq6aiyzt5q/monitoring-puzzle.png&quot;&gt;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/vj83geq6aiyzt5q/monitoring-puzzle.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant now has a public continuous integration server, which bodes well for future stability. As a fast moving project dependent on a third party piece of software in VirtualBox this is particularly important in avoiding version mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent looking list for anyone in a hurry to lock down a PHP application server. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty extensive and at least tries to explain the why as well as giving you the commands to run. Some of the comments add a few more ideas as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice presentation from Patrick Debois about taking learnings from the management of production infrastructure and applying that back to managing development environments and test machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/manage-your-devtestprod-like-a-cloud&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/manage-your-devtestprod-like-a-cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting post describing using Hubot (the GitHub campfire bot) for triggering deployments. Interestingly thought this is in a .NET and Teamcity context. Some good ideas and sample code for extending hubot as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomb.io/posts/hubot-ci-and-deploying/&quot;&gt;http://tomb.io/posts/hubot-ci-and-deploying/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video from the recent London Puppet user group meetup, with Ken Barber talking on Puppet, Private Clouds and Building Solutions. It looks to be a pretty nice demo of OpenNebula as well as some Puppet tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/32197839&quot;&gt;http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/32197839&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CitCon, the Continuous Integration conference took place a few weeks back, and this post summarises a few of the talking points. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in someone writing up the discussions around feature branching too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jr0cket.blogspot.com/2011/11/7-continuous-integration-ideas-from.html&quot;&gt;http://jr0cket.blogspot.com/2011/11/7-continuous-integration-ideas-from.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly didn&amp;rsquo;t include this next post, because it&amp;rsquo;s a Chef vs Puppet one. However it&amp;rsquo;s relatively balanced and stresses the answer to which to use is probably &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. The interesting quote that swung it for me was &amp;ldquo;I often wonder if Chef is the right tool because it&amp;rsquo;s the second one we&amp;rsquo;ve used&amp;rdquo;. I definitely agree with this, leaning a tool (Chef or Puppet) and a pattern like configuration management at the same time is a big ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nathenharvey.blogspot.com/2011/11/why-we-chose-puppet-over-chef-at.html&quot;&gt;http://nathenharvey.blogspot.com/2011/11/why-we-chose-puppet-over-chef-at.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cases where you want to use Chef without the server component, Pocketknife looks interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s a set of configuration conventions and a nice command line interface for syncing and running chef-solo on a remote machine. Personally I like this sort of thing for local virtual machines or short lived instances used for development. You should probably be using the server if you&amp;rsquo;re managing production machines in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/igal/pocketknife&quot;&gt;https://github.com/igal/pocketknife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to get the stream of Nagios events onto a message queue this project might be worth a look. It consists of two components that, when combined, use Nagios Event Broker to gather data and output the messages using STOMP to Activemq. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in seeing things built atop that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/neb2activemq/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/neb2activemq/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KermIT appears to be an open source web application frontend to a Puppet master and Mcollective. Limited documentation at the moment but the videos looks very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kermit.fr/&quot;&gt;http://www.kermit.fr/&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Issue 47 - 20th November 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/11/20/issue-47/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 47 &amp;ndash; 20th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully a good mix of content this week; new tools, existing tools, culture change, new services and some excellent presentations. Oh and a very exciting job for someone. Let me know what you&amp;rsquo;d like to see more (or less) of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both a big fan of Jenkins and a frequent Ruby developer I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about the newly released ability to write Jenkins plugins in Ruby. Although only some parts of the API are natively available using JRuby means you can just delve into the Java if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jenkins-ci.org/content/beginning-new-era-ruby-plugins-now-reality&quot;&gt;http://jenkins-ci.org/content/beginning-new-era-ruby-plugins-now-reality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post suggests past some things developers and operations can agree on is a large gap which needs more discussion, namely standardisation. Mature automation probably means limiting what&amp;rsquo;s being automated, and getting the conversation going about what is in a corporate wide supported platform should be done sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://saviorodrigues.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/no-devops-without-standardization-2/&quot;&gt;http://saviorodrigues.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/no-devops-without-standardization-2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Percona Live MySQL conference held in London earlier in the year have released all the slides to the two days of talks. Lots of interesting looking material if you&amp;rsquo;re using or interested in MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/slides/&quot;&gt;http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/slides/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article on another area of misaligned incentives, cutting operations teams because everything is running smoothly. I liked the statement &amp;ldquo;there is no easy way to prove your worth when it’s only apparent when things go wrong&amp;rdquo; and the fact the article points out this isn&amp;rsquo;t something you can easily fight against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.real-user-monitoring.com/when-it-ops-is-a-victim-of-its-own-competence/&quot;&gt;http://www.real-user-monitoring.com/when-it-ops-is-a-victim-of-its-own-competence/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned Pennyworth last week in the tools section, it&amp;rsquo;s a Jenkins based continuous deployment system which makes extensive use of Chef under the hood. This blog post acts as a quick start tutorial and should make getting started easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://junglist.gen.nz/blog/2011/11/16/pennyworth-quick-start/&quot;&gt;http://junglist.gen.nz/blog/2011/11/16/pennyworth-quick-start/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only in beta at the moment but Boundary looks to be another thing that can be purchased as a service, this time it&amp;rsquo;s Network monitoring. Chef and Puppet code and support for Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows7, and MacOS X out of the gate too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://boundary.com/&quot;&gt;https://boundary.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent looking presentation on building usable command line interfaces. The later examples provide lots of good tips for people writing in Ruby, but much of the rest is relevant to everyone. Well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awesome-cli-ruby.heroku.com/#1&quot;&gt;http://awesome-cli-ruby.heroku.com/#1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real world stories of failure are always informative and useful, and this article with examples of monitoring lying to you are fantastic. It&amp;rsquo;s a good list that anyone can go back and look at their monitoring with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/11/15/why-your-monitoring-is-lying-to-you/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/11/15/why-your-monitoring-is-lying-to-you/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripe is building next-generation infrastructure for online payments, and we&amp;rsquo;re expanding our devops team. If you love building highly scalable, chaos monkey-proof systems; if automating tasks is muscle memory; and if taking updates is a cathartic experience, then you should do-release-upgrade to Stripe. To apply, send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#x6a;&amp;#111;&amp;#x62;&amp;#115;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x73;&amp;#116;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x70;&amp;#x65;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#106;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#98;&amp;#x73;&amp;#64;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#x69;&amp;#112;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#x6d;&lt;/a&gt; with your Github and Twitter usernames and a rant about an infrastructure tool of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulse is the log stream parsing engine used by Heroku for real time monitoring of their platform. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to see how this fits into anyone else&amp;rsquo;s architecture as it looks very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/heroku/pulse&quot;&gt;https://github.com/heroku/pulse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend an awful lot of time using a terminal, but until now one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve generally used other tools for is quick visualisations. Enter Spark, a command line spark lines script. The quick examples, showing git commit patterns and data from a url using common command line tools are great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/holman/spark&quot;&gt;https://github.com/holman/spark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt looks like an interesting new entry to the remote execution game. It&amp;rsquo;s Python based and using 0MQ under the hood. Lots of documentation and lots of supported platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://saltstack.org/&quot;&gt;http://saltstack.org/&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Issue 46 - 13th November 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/11/13/issue-46/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 46 &amp;ndash; 13th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wish I had enough time to delve into all the content I feature
in these weekly emails. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s the same for many readers, so many
interesting goings on and too little time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of devops flavoured conversations talk about automation and tools,
but without really defining either. This post does just that and it&amp;rsquo;s
definitions should probably be adopted here on in. The points raised
about how automation can clash with existing uses of tools is nicely put
as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/11/tools-vs-automation.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/11/tools-vs-automation.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not always a fan of Capistrano, but past the defaults it&amp;rsquo;s
surprisingly flexible. This post covers some of those features,
including using several of the supported environment variables to manage
which hosts get tasks run on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.railsware.com/2011/11/02/advanced-server-definitions-in-capistrano/&quot;&gt;http://blog.railsware.com/2011/11/02/advanced-server-definitions-in-capistrano/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us not able to get to Velocity Europe this last week can at
least relive some of the experience by watching the videos of some of
the sessions, already uploaded to YouTube. 15 good lucking videos
available so far covering quite a range of interesting topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PLEF30FFC877957631&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PLEF30FFC877957631&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea in the monitoring space, monitoring.txt aims to be
for monitoring what robots.txt is for web crawlers. Currently it&amp;rsquo;s
related to a soon to be released commercial monitoring tool but in
theory it could be used by any monitoring framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://monitorstxt.org/&quot;&gt;http://monitorstxt.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet come up with a way of using Puppet environments that I
like, but many interesting conversations at Puppetconf were had on the
subject. This article shows a few tricks for using dynamic environments
based on git branches. The post commit hook example is particularly
useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/git-workflow-and-puppet-environments/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/git-workflow-and-puppet-environments/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain circles, conversation often turns to writing tests for
configuration management code. And hopefully the day is fast approaching
where this will be just how we do things. This blog post helps,
explaining why this is a good idea if you&amp;rsquo;re not already test infected,
and then showing how to test a puppet module with spec-puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bombasticmonkey.com/2011/11/04/test-your-puppet-modules-functions/&quot;&gt;http://bombasticmonkey.com/2011/11/04/test-your-puppet-modules-functions/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second article from Tim Sharpe, this one a nice Puppet story, with the
ending being that &amp;ldquo;anything is possible in Puppet if you’re willing to
get your hands dirty&amp;rdquo;. Puppet might provide a quite specific DSL, but if
you&amp;rsquo;re happy with Ruby you can take things much further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bombasticmonkey.com/2011/11/13/autonotify-resources-from-your-puppet-types/&quot;&gt;http://bombasticmonkey.com/2011/11/13/autonotify-resources-from-your-puppet-types/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah is the lightweight node/service registry from John Vincent,
inspired by Apache Zookeeper. John has a number of fairly large changes
he&amp;rsquo;s considering to make Noah more flexible and he&amp;rsquo;s looking for
feedback on some of the proposals. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re an existing user or
just interested worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lusis/Noah/wiki/Possible-changes-in-Noah&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lusis/Noah/wiki/Possible-changes-in-Noah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graylog2 is about to see a 0.9.6 release with some pretty large changes.
In particular log messages will no longer be stored in MongoDB,
requiring an ElasticSearch backend. This apparently resolves issues some
folks have had accessing large amounts of logs previously. Some changes
to graph rendering should also speed things up too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lennartkoopmann.net/post/12512504316/whats-coming-graylog2-v096&quot;&gt;http://www.lennartkoopmann.net/post/12512504316/whats-coming-graylog2-v096&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ScaleConf is a new 2 day conference being held in Cape Town in January
next year. They are currently looking for speakers and sponsors so if
you&amp;rsquo;re interested get in touch with the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scaleconf.org/&quot;&gt;http://scaleconf.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioned at work this week, this Ruby gem is a code coverage tool for
CSS. It&amp;rsquo;s aim is to find rules which are not longer used, letting you
delete them. This is good both from a performance point of view as well
as a maintenance one, less code is nearly always more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aanand/deadweight&quot;&gt;https://github.com/aanand/deadweight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pennyworth describes itself as &amp;ldquo;a continuous packaging system built
around Opscode&amp;rsquo;s Chef, Jenkins and the fpm packaging tool&amp;rdquo;. It ships
with vagrant support for testing, a wide range of Chef cookbooks and
some interesting looking data bag driven configuration. Would love to
see a walk through or detailed tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 45 - 6th November 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/11/06/issue-45/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/11/06/issue-45</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 45 &amp;ndash; 6th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With having just hit 2000 subscribers to this newsletter I thought I&amp;rsquo;d
take a moment to say a huge thank you to everyone who has written a blog
post, posted slides or video from a talk or built a tool I&amp;rsquo;ve featured
over the last 45 issues. This would be a much less interesting email and
importantly a much less vibrant community without the culture of
sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is great for quickly managing local virtual machines for
development, but if you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to even more accurately simulate the
network from a production cluster you have to delve into how VirtualBox
does its thing. This post does just that with details of VLAN, PXE boot
and bridged network support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2011/11/04/vagrant-virtualbox-hostonly-pxe-vlans/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2011/11/04/vagrant-virtualbox-hostonly-pxe-vlans/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice example of a shared puppet module for Cloudera&amp;rsquo;s Hadoop
distribution. Mainly picking out as I like the provided Vagrant
configuration which lets you play around with a three machine cluster
quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thattommyhall/cloudera-cdh3-puppet&quot;&gt;https://github.com/thattommyhall/cloudera-cdh3-puppet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is an often used term, and this article takes that and
describes it in terms of infrastructure. It&amp;rsquo;s a good take on the need to
automate where possible and raises good points about some of the people
and process things that need to be changed to make it happen. I
particularly liked the point that &amp;ldquo;people terribly underestimate the
amount of manual work they do to accomplish a task&amp;rdquo; which rings true in
my experience too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2011/11/03/infrastructure-debt/&quot;&gt;http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2011/11/03/infrastructure-debt/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as devops is about changes to processes and culture, lots of it
is also driven by people with a deep interest in tooling. And not only
are people writing tools or automating things, they are releasing them
at an ever increasing rate. This post tries to get across why it&amp;rsquo;s
nearly always worth it to clean up that code and throw it into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kartar.net/2011/11/why-am-i-a-tool-maker%3f/&quot;&gt;http://kartar.net/2011/11/why-am-i-a-tool-maker%3f/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chef is purposefully not opinionated about what you might want to manage
with it. But the flexibility is there to provide cookbooks with
expressive DSL, for example this one for application deployment. The
description of these as &amp;ldquo;deployment macros&amp;rdquo; I like, and the fact it&amp;rsquo;s
already managing application written in Java, Scala, Erlang, Ruby and
static sites bodes well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.boundary.com/2011/11/01/the-apps-cookbook-and-application-deployments.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.boundary.com/2011/11/01/the-apps-cookbook-and-application-deployments.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice introductory presentation covering why packaging up your Java
applications as RPMs is generally a good idea. Covers everything from
the problems, what you need to do to fix them and other advantages like
simplifying configuration management manifests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/actionjackx/automated-java-deployments-with-rpm&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/actionjackx/automated-java-deployments-with-rpm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great &amp;ldquo;one month with chef&amp;rdquo; article, talking through the learning
curve, how it changes how work got done and with a great list of things
worth knowing before starting. Well worth reading if you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of
getting in to Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/month-with-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/month-with-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensu is a new take on the monitoring problem, using a message queue for
command distribution and discovery and a fast key value store for
keeping track of hosts and checks. It certainly sounds interesting,
although I&amp;rsquo;d love to see a screen capture of similar to get a better
feel for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://portertech.ca/2011/11/01/sensu-a-monitoring-framework/&quot;&gt;http://portertech.ca/2011/11/01/sensu-a-monitoring-framework/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sonian/sensu&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sonian/sensu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Databaseliner describes itself as &amp;ldquo;a tool for spidering a database to
produce a referentially integral subset of data&amp;rdquo;. One use case is for
creating useful datasets for testing purposes based on production data.
Currently it comes with outputs for Postgres and Oracle, but with a bit
of hacking you could add others too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steppenwells/databaseliner&quot;&gt;https://github.com/steppenwells/databaseliner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VirtualBox guest additions updates can cause problems with Vagrant
base boxes which haven&amp;rsquo;t been created with the latest tools installed.
The three way fight between the version of vagrant, virtual box and the
guest additions has bit me personally a few times. This plugin aims to
help, providing an option for the vagrant file to keep everything up to
date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 44 &amp;ndash; 30th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week, another set of high quality articles from around the web.
This time next week devopsweekly will probably have over 2000
subscribers which is pretty impressive. And I still believe we&amp;rsquo;re just
the early adopters at this point. Anyway, on with the real content and a
shamelessly promoted opportunity for someone to come and work with me at
the day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in any doubt that devops is attracting a wider audience of
late then have a read through this Wired article. I have to admit I&amp;rsquo;m
mainly including this due to the title: The Chef, the Puppet, and the
Sexy IT Admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/10/chef_and_puppet/&quot;&gt;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/10/chef_and_puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppet has a pretty powerful extension system taking advantage of Ruby
to add new functionality at runtime. This article, the first in a
series, covers some of those integration points and shows lots of code
examples that making it easier to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/10/29/puppet-extension-points-part-1/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/10/29/puppet-extension-points-part-1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosdem, the free and open source conference held each year in Belgium is
looking for main track speakers for next year event. Last years
configuration management room was excellent so hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll see more
good devops flavoured content next year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2012/call-main-track&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2012/call-main-track&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article acting as a counterpoint to all the ones talking about
moving to cloud based hosting. Mixpanel have recently moved to dedicated
hardware, getting better performance and lower costs out of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.mixpanel.com/2011/10/27/why-we-moved-off-the-cloud/&quot;&gt;http://code.mixpanel.com/2011/10/27/why-we-moved-off-the-cloud/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Reese gave a presentation at the recent Camp DevOps about some of
the overlaps and resulting benefits of adopting devops approaches in a
cloud environment. The main thread appears to be APIs for everything,
allowing for the entire system (not just the software) to be defined in
code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/10/23/devops-in-the-cloud-explained/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/10/23/devops-in-the-cloud-explained/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice rebuttal of the argument that you can automate yourself out of a
job. Also nice to think about documentation as a fallback when
automation is not possible or too costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/10/automate-will-i-lose-my-job.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/10/automate-will-i-lose-my-job.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another writeup from a Camp DevOps talk, this time from Seth Thomson and
Chris Read on Overcoming Organizational Hurdles. The reiteration that
change is hard and communication is important is always welcome, and the
idea that you should get people to pull you in rather than push them
into doing something I found interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/10/22/overcoming-organizational-hurdles/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/10/22/overcoming-organizational-hurdles/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I current work for the UK Government, in a brand new department called
Government Digital Service. Our remit is nothing short of fundamentally
changing how the Government operates online, and we&amp;rsquo;re looking for more
smart people. We&amp;rsquo;re currently on the lookout for developers and systems
administrators of all experience levels and backgrounds. Some details
are available on the following links but if you have any questions just
drop me an email at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#x67;&amp;#x61;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#104;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x73;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#x65;&amp;#116;&quot;&gt;&amp;#103;&amp;#x61;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x74;&amp;#104;&amp;#x40;&amp;#109;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#104;&amp;#x61;&amp;#110;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x65;&amp;#118;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 1.4 of Rundeck, the framework for automating ad-hoc and routine
command execution, has been released. Feels like development is
progressing at quite a clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtolabs/rundeck/blob/v1.4.0.1/RELEASE.md&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dtolabs/rundeck/blob/v1.4.0.1/RELEASE.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at GitHub have talked quite a bit about Hubot, their campfire
bot which triggers deploys, queries the web and opens the office door
among other things. A cleaned up version of the code has been released
and we&amp;rsquo;re already seeing lots of plugins being added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks appear to be building tools around Graphite of late.
Tattle looks interesting, described as a self service alerting and
dashboard frontend for graphite. So now you can get alerts when data
sets change or thresholds are passed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 43 &amp;ndash; 23rd October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to our usual Sunday schedule this week after the Devopsdays special
last weekend. Even without a very lively conference their are still lots
of well written articles and interesting new tools around. Hopefully
something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment is always a hot topic, and this series of posts is looking to
document common patterns including dark launches, feature flags, smoke
tests and backwards compatibility. Essential reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/10/18/deploy-all-the-things/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/10/18/deploy-all-the-things/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of pattern repositories has been around a while and can be a
good way of documenting best practices. This site currently covers
environment abstraction, fix the automation, not the symptom and
database changes as code. Hopefully more on the way, and more discussion
around shared patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopswire.com/patterns/repository&quot;&gt;http://devopswire.com/patterns/repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing Git is becoming more and more important with the huge amount of
useful software found on GitHub and other online repositories like
BitBucket. This online book looks an excellent starting place for
learning all the ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yanpritzker.com/git-book/&quot;&gt;http://yanpritzker.com/git-book/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagios is the mainstay for many people monitoring hosts and services,
and this projects adds a JSON based API and a command line interface for
getting information out of Nagois. Patches welcome for adding new
features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qq.is/article/announcing-a-nagios-api&quot;&gt;http://qq.is/article/announcing-a-nagios-api&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of interesting tools along with configuration management
and a nice command line interface can make experimenting with things
much simpler. This project takes the Graylog2 logging application and
uses puppet and capistrano to turn a new virtual machine into a fully
working logging server. Can someone do this for Graphite as well please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/aussielunix/graylog2-appliance&quot;&gt;https://bitbucket.org/aussielunix/graylog2-appliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice presentation bringing design and quality assurance roles into the
typical developer and operations mix. I particularly liked the Given,
When, Then examples of operations and support stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/ingineeringit/design-dev-qa-ops&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/ingineeringit/design-dev-qa-ops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes from the Camp Devops talk on how Groupon have scaled their
operations. From 100 servers in a single location a year ago, to more
than 1000 servers in six locations today. Groupon have an in-house
configuration management tool called Roller and the notes cover some of
the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/10/22/groupon-clean-and-simple-devops-with-roller/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/10/22/groupon-clean-and-simple-devops-with-roller/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you store sensitive data for use in configuration management is an
important topic. Chef now has encrypted data bags which are a nice
solution. This article covers a puppet approach using the new Hiera
backend. Good post with lots of code examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigdunn.org/2011/10/secret-variables-in-puppet-with-hiera-and-gpg/&quot;&gt;http://www.craigdunn.org/2011/10/secret-variables-in-puppet-with-hiera-and-gpg/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short presentation on testing in an operations context. Lots of good
ideas, and importantly examples, of the types of tests you might write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrislaco.com/slides/clerb-testing.pdf&quot;&gt;http://chrislaco.com/slides/clerb-testing.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week, another Statsd clone. This time in Scala. It&amp;rsquo;s compatible
with the statsd protocol so it&amp;rsquo;s a drop in replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojodna/metricsd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mojodna/metricsd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice looking command line tool from Instagram for making SSH access to
EC2 instances easier without having to remember public instance
addresses or deal ever changing DNS entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/11399488246/simplifying-ec2-ssh-connections&quot;&gt;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/11399488246/simplifying-ec2-ssh-connections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of continuous delivery examples have been built on top of a
continuous integration server, but Nariya is built from scratch using
node.js. It&amp;rsquo;s quite opinionated and looks to be best suited for other
node.js projects hosted on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arunoda/nariya&quot;&gt;https://github.com/arunoda/nariya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 42 - 17th October 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/17/issue-42/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/17/issue-42</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 42 &amp;ndash; 17th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day late but hopefully the extra content will placate any angry
readers. I just got back from another excellent Devopsdays event, this
time in Sweden. Thanks hugely to Patrick, Ulf and all those involved in
organising, speaking and participating. For those that couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it
here are lots of the slides, and a few notes from some of the open
spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Devopsdays&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely one of the highlights of the event was the talk from
Mitchell Hashimoto (of Vagrant fame). It stresses that all the many
things we put under the devops banner exist on a scale and talks about
the order you might try and implement many of the things we talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/mitchellh/p/the-wide-range-of-devops&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/mitchellh/p/the-wide-range-of-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian Simpson and Tom Sulston gave one of the talks in Sweden, entitled
everything I know about continuous integration I learned from System
Administration. It has a number of good takeaway points about how you
may be going about CI. The slides only tell part of the story so watch
out for the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.build-doctor.com/2011/10/17/everything-i-know-about-continuous-integration-i-learned-from-systems-administration/&quot;&gt;http://www.build-doctor.com/2011/10/17/everything-i-know-about-continuous-integration-i-learned-from-systems-administration/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Vincent&amp;rsquo;s talk stressed the importance of tools, at least some of
the time anyway. The talk took a number of common areas of operations
(configuration management, packaging, monitoring, etc.) and tried to
show a before and after snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/sometimes-tools-matter&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/sometimes-tools-matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Ignite talks by Michael Brunton-Spall from The Guardian
seemed to entertain most of the audience. It&amp;rsquo;s a lightning quick tale of
a real project with a number of ups and downs, all talking place over a
matter of days. A good talk developer to developer to challenge
assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mibuk/ignitedevopsdays-why-devs-need-ops&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/mibuk/ignitedevopsdays-why-devs-need-ops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the lightning talks was on ITIL and Devops. The presenter has
nicely made available both the slides and the notes, which at least
until the video is available, make interesting reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rslomkow.org/share/963830F6-B592-4B41-ACE7-ED4344D9FFDB/ITIL-for-agile-notes.pdf&quot;&gt;http://rslomkow.org/share/963830F6-B592-4B41-ACE7-ED4344D9FFDB/ITIL-for-agile-notes.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the open spaces I missed has already been well written up. This
one covered Java application development and for those involved in that
topic every day this sounded excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mccartney.ie/wordpress/2011/10/246/&quot;&gt;http://www.mccartney.ie/wordpress/2011/10/246/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other open spaces covered tools people where finding useful.
This post includes links to all of them, a good 40 or 50 in total. Not
all of them I&amp;rsquo;m convinced by but it&amp;rsquo;s a good starting place for some
research if you like keeping up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://paperairoplane.net/?p=320&quot;&gt;http://paperairoplane.net/?p=320&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all the Devopsdays content isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, all of the videos from
Puppetconf are now available. The talks I saw were excellent, and I&amp;rsquo;m
hoping to find time to catch all the ones in the tracks I didn&amp;rsquo;t get
along to. Lots of good puppet content, plus a good number of talks
relevant to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/videos-from-puppetconf-available/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/videos-from-puppetconf-available/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good long explanation of why to choose Chef, which (apart from the
many good examples) is really a solid argument for any form of
configuration management. The good points and bad give it balance and
the mythbusting is welcome (in particular in light of some of the
comments anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/why-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/why-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays was definitely a practitioners conference, so it&amp;rsquo;s still
great to see articles like this one, covering what Devops is and why you
should care. It&amp;rsquo;s main points are around host devops approaches can work
in agile software teams, with the main emphasis on getting development
and operations together rather than pitting then against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agileelephant.blogspot.com/2011/09/introduction-to-devops.html?m=1&quot;&gt;http://agileelephant.blogspot.com/2011/09/introduction-to-devops.html?m=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather provocative post suggesting an end to the Sysadmin within 10
years. Some of the points are obvious, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s more about
evolution and increasing specialisation (not everything is a web
application for instance). Lots of comments too which make for some
interesting points amongst the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://peebs.org/ill-probably-never-hire-another-pure-sysadmin&quot;&gt;http://peebs.org/ill-probably-never-hire-another-pure-sysadmin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla are interesting in that the majority of the code they produce is
open source. Getting in-house developers up and running can be tricky in
some organisation, but Mozilla want to encourage external developers
too. This post covers that problem, and the current solution using
Vagrant to distribute a virtual machine that anyone can get start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/&quot;&gt;http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late night deployments are generally a bad idea and a sign of other
wider issues. This post does a fantastic job of taking all the reasons
you probably do it and debunking them, in particular with examples of
using feature flags to solve some time depend events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://briancrescimanno.com/2011/09/29/why-are-you-still-deploying-overnight/&quot;&gt;http://briancrescimanno.com/2011/09/29/why-are-you-still-deploying-overnight/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using EC2 and you can&amp;rsquo;t get your instances booted quickly
because of the time taken for a configuration management run this
approach might be of interest. It&amp;rsquo;s demonstrating a puppet module which
can be used to keep a set of AMI images up to date with puppet
manifests, so when you boot new instances they are already bang up to
date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/rapid-scaling-with-auto-generated-amis-using-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/rapid-scaling-with-auto-generated-amis-using-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Vagrant and doing Ruby development a few people have
asked how I open the source of gems on the guest. Actually I just use
vim all the time on the virtual machine but if you&amp;rsquo;re happier with
Textmate or and IDE of some description running on the host then vagrant
bundler tools is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mocoso/vagrant-bundler-tools&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mocoso/vagrant-bundler-tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statsd, the stats aggregation tool for Graphite from Etsy, is very nice.
But some folks just aren&amp;rsquo;t happy or able to run Node.js applications.
Statsite is a Python implementation of the tool that supports all the
Graphite data types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kiip/statsite&quot;&gt;https://github.com/kiip/statsite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fig describes itself as a utility for configuring environments and
managing dependencies across a team of developers. It&amp;rsquo;s something like
Apache Ivy, but not just for Java applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mfoemmel/fig&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mfoemmel/fig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 41 &amp;ndash; 9th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to be off on another devops floured trip this week, to
Sweden for the third Devopsdays Europe event. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping it will be
just as interesting, friendly and informative as last year. If you&amp;rsquo;re
going to be attending come find me and say Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really nice article which should be relevant to anyone involved in
software development and operations, about how to ensure useful
communication in a crisis. Much of this is about up front planning and
practice, but the examples and approaches make this article a good read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has spent lots of time with Python but who is now mainly
writing Ruby this post about Ruby becoming the de facto System
Administration programming language is interesting. Some of the comments
are also interesting, even if some devolve into language wars a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-ruby-is-beating-python-in-battle.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-ruby-is-beating-python-in-battle.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like the Chef Windows support has been coming along nicely of
late and people are posting more how-to&amp;rsquo;s. This one shows how to ensure
idempotence by checking whether something is installed in the Windows
registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://delivermind.blogspot.com/2011/10/windows-msi-idempotence-with-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://delivermind.blogspot.com/2011/10/windows-msi-idempotence-with-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plea to get rid of silos in organisation which allow one group (lets
say developers) to cause pain to another (their operations colleagues).
I definitely agree with the theme, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the solution is
to get rid of different roles completely, more to improve collaboration
and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.recursivity.com/post/10842820535/developers-must-feel-the-pain-of-operations&quot;&gt;http://blog.recursivity.com/post/10842820535/developers-must-feel-the-pain-of-operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Puppet Labs folk have posted a short list of blog posts from
attendees to Puppet Conf last week. I&amp;rsquo;m still digesting some of the
excellent talks. Anyone else who made it along and has written up their
thoughts let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/puppetconf-blog-round-up/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/puppetconf-blog-round-up/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good set of Vagrant tutorial blog posts taking you from getting
started, through creating your own base boxes up to using Puppet to
manage software on the virtual machine. Rather that just the facts found
in the official docs these posts are a little more flavoured by a real
world scenario and make a good starting point for anyone interested in
Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.me/2011/10/05/vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://devops.me/2011/10/05/vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.me/2011/10/06/building-baseboxes/&quot;&gt;http://devops.me/2011/10/06/building-baseboxes/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.me/2011/10/07/bootstrapping-vagrant-with-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://devops.me/2011/10/07/bootstrapping-vagrant-with-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of updating the puppet modules on your puppet master is using
the mcmasterupdate collective plugin. This article shows how this is
done using a simple svn commit hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flybyunix.carlcaum.com/2011/10/automatically-updating-your-puppet.html&quot;&gt;http://flybyunix.carlcaum.com/2011/10/automatically-updating-your-puppet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people talk about their software architecture, but fewer talk
about mistakes and how they solved them over time. This article about
how Etsy has changed over time is interesting, stressing the positive
impact of web operations folks on the eventual system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/10/when-clever-goes-wrong-how-etsy-overcame-poor-architectural-choices.ars&quot;&gt;http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/10/when-clever-goes-wrong-how-etsy-overcame-poor-architectural-choices.ars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camp Devops, which is taking place later this month in Chicago, now has
a full line-up of talks announced. With sessions on Continuous Delivery,
Puppet, Jenkins and Graphite amongst other topics and a day long
hackathon it should be a pretty good tools focused few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://campdevops.com/sessions&quot;&gt;http://campdevops.com/sessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDash is a nice looking project for anyone using Graphite. It&amp;rsquo;s a small
Ruby web application designed for building customisable dashboards of
Graphite metrics. You describe what you want in a simple configuration
and you can easily run the dashboard on Heroku if you&amp;rsquo;re not up on
hosting Ruby based web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/10/08/gdash-graphite-dashboard.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/10/08/gdash-graphite-dashboard.php&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Issue 40 - 2nd October 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/02/issue-40/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/02/issue-40</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 40 &amp;ndash; 2nd October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, sorry for the missing issue last week. Sunday had me
travelling the 5000 miles or so back home from Puppetconf so it
definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t due to a lack of good content. Puppetconf was
excellent and I&amp;rsquo;ll make an effort to track down any blog posts I can
find once I get a moment. Now on with two weeks worth of news and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more people start using tools like Chef an ecosystem can develop, and
Grill is the first commercial tool I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that plugs into a Chef
based infrastructure. It&amp;rsquo;s a monitoring tool which makes use of Chef and
lets you see nodes which have got out of sync amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cyclecomputing.com/grill/overview&quot;&gt;http://cyclecomputing.com/grill/overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love finding good sized configuration management repos to delve into.
This one comes from the folks at Wikimedia and contains lots of puppet
modules folks might find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/09/19/ever-wondered-how-the-wikimedia-servers-are-configured/&quot;&gt;http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/09/19/ever-wondered-how-the-wikimedia-servers-are-configured/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teams have certain tasks that can only safely be run by one person
or group at once, and the use of some token to prevent disaster is a
common pattern. Pass the Puppy is a simple service (you can run your own
version if you prefer) to help in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pass-the-puppy.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;http://pass-the-puppy.heroku.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stevemoyer.net/2011/09/distributed-check-in-tokens-pass-puppy.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.stevemoyer.net/2011/09/distributed-check-in-tokens-pass-puppy.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this article about the changing skill set of developers
interesting. It mentioned the need to know a little more about making
applications that are deployable and manageable, as well as lots of
other things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/202999/what-todays-software-developers-need-know&quot;&gt;http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/202999/what-todays-software-developers-need-know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RemoteAdmin is a Android and iPhone application for managing Foreman and
Puppet. It&amp;rsquo;s baed on the APIs exposed by those tools and the screenshots
look excellent. I&amp;rsquo;d love to see a review of this form anyone who&amp;rsquo;s
already using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/logicminds/remoteadmin-mobile/wiki&quot;&gt;https://github.com/logicminds/remoteadmin-mobile/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Foundry seems to be having quite a push to make running a cluster
yourself easier which is good. This post covers running multiple nodes
using Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/10816758982/using-chef-to-customize-multi-node-cloud-foundry&quot;&gt;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/10816758982/using-chef-to-customize-multi-node-cloud-foundry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone likes the default Puppet requirement for mandatory client
certificates. This gist introduces a different approach that uses facts
rather than the SSL Distinguished Name to determine the classes for a
node, making reusing certs easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1182243&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/1182243&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice write-up of the build a cloud day ahead of Puppetconf. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
manage to get to Portland in time for this event but it sounded very
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/openshift/blogs/a-report-from-build-a-cloud-day-at-puppetconf&quot;&gt;https://www.redhat.com/openshift/blogs/a-report-from-build-a-cloud-day-at-puppetconf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can just drop everything and start using a configuration
management tool. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t work towards Chef or Puppet
by making existing shell scripts easier to manage. Rerun looks an
interesting approach to making a standard interface for an existing
suite of shell tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/9/26/puppet-and-chef-rock-doh-what-about-all-these-shell-scripts.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/9/26/puppet-and-chef-rock-doh-what-about-all-these-shell-scripts.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtolabs/rerun/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dtolabs/rerun/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our infrastructure is code, things like change management can be
more easily automated. This article delves into how the folks at
Alassian use their own suite of tools to manage a request for a change.
Always interesting to see other folks processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2011/09/puppet-change-management-for-devops.html&quot;&gt;http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2011/09/puppet-change-management-for-devops.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been increasingly using FPM for making system packages, so FPM
Cookery looks interesting. It uses FPM for creating packages, but
provides some conventions and tools around building the software you
want in the package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bernd/fpm-cookery&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bernd/fpm-cookery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to draw diagrams but not felt like moving out of vim (or
your editor of choice)? With Ditaa you can generate a wide range of flow
chart diagrams from nothing more than ascii text. It had me at the
example at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More folks are using Configuration Management tools as part of
application deployment and this is a nice  (and very well documented)
puppet module aimed at managing Python WSGI and Django web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.uggedal.com/deploying-wsgi-applications-with-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://journal.uggedal.com/deploying-wsgi-applications-with-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uggedal/puppet-module-webapp&quot;&gt;https://github.com/uggedal/puppet-module-webapp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scales is a Python web application and library for collecting metrics
data from your application or servers. It has a nice built in web server
for showing data and integrates with Graphite for tracking data over
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greplin/scales&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Greplin/scales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 39 &amp;ndash; 18th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next weeks issue of Devops Weekly might be a little late, because next
week I&amp;rsquo;m heading to Portland for PuppetConf. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be there
come and say hello , I&amp;rsquo;ll be the small English fellow hanging around the
devops track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme for Devopsdays Europe is out, and I&amp;rsquo;m even more happy that
I&amp;rsquo;ll be making it along again that before. Six really interesting
looking sessions with a good mix of case studies and interesting
discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/program/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/program/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of technologies, programming languages and systems used these
days for building web applications is much larger than even a few years
ago. This site looks to be a interesting overview of that change, with a
long wiki like list of technologies to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackparts.com/&quot;&gt;http://stackparts.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canonical folks have started posting some examples of using Ensemble
to build various stacks. This post covers a node.js, mongodb and haproxy
deployment. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in the specific technology
used, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the command line interface for working
with ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/09/node-js-and-mongodb-on-ubuntu/&quot;&gt;http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/09/node-js-and-mongodb-on-ubuntu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice impassioned plea to get ops savvy people involved in the design
of services alongside developers. Also talks about the importance of
positioning operational metrics and data as something of interest to
developers as well as prioritising what to do first in the move towards
a devops mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/12/wont-somebody-please-think-of-the-systems/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/12/wont-somebody-please-think-of-the-systems/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post looks at what hoops need jumping through to get CloudFoundry
running in EC2 from the latest source. Particularly impressive is
running the applications across multiple instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudsoftcorp.com/blogs/first-steps-with-cloud-foundry-on-amazon-ec2&quot;&gt;http://www.cloudsoftcorp.com/blogs/first-steps-with-cloud-foundry-on-amazon-ec2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another setting up CloudFoundry article, this time using the new
packages in Ubuntu 11.10. Having started hacking on CloudFoundry when it
was released it&amp;rsquo;s great to see working packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/08/howto-install-cloudfoundry-server-paas.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/08/howto-install-cloudfoundry-server-paas.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice 20 minute talk on Devops, Devops, Devops from Kris Buytaert at
the recent Startup Weekend Brussels. A nice introductory run through
many of the devops concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IhstaBetkk&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IhstaBetkk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with as many servers as Facebook will always have some of them
down. FBAR is one of the tools they have developed to make this as self
healing as possible and this article suggests the software now
maintained by two full time developers does the work of two hundred
system administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/making-facebook-self-healing/10150275248698920&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/making-facebook-self-healing/10150275248698920&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PubSub Huddle is a free one-day conference in London to talk about all
things messaging. Talks on RabbitMQ,  ØMQ and an afternoon of lightning
talks and ad-hoc sessions is planned. Worthwhile if you&amp;rsquo;re in London on
Friday 23rd of September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pubsubhuddle.com/&quot;&gt;http://pubsubhuddle.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Puppet is described as a Ruby DSL for Puppet, giving those that
prefer it a different way of writing Puppet manifests in this case as
Ruby classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/railsmachine/shadow_puppet/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/railsmachine/shadow_puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcollective 1.3.1 is out, which is a development branch release and
features a much improved node filtering syntax and a fast node to node
communication mechanism via the same middleware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/releasenotes.html#1_3_1&quot;&gt;http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/releasenotes.html#1_3_1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boss is a library designed to allow you to perform simple master
election while knowing little about your peers, specifically designed
for use with Chef. Light on documentation, but the included Vagrant file
lets you try it out very quickly. Hopefully something we&amp;rsquo;ll see in other
projects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fujin/boss&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fujin/boss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecks is another new tool designed as a simple way to get data out of a
remote machine using SNMP. It&amp;rsquo;s a python application, with a simple to
use interface for extracting information like uptime, load average,
running processes and cpu usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cread/ecks&quot;&gt;https://github.com/cread/ecks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of seeing the growth in any community is the growth in events
around it. And as I&amp;rsquo;m finding more and more events I&amp;rsquo;ll try and
highlight any interesting ones each week. If you&amp;rsquo;re involved in
organising anything that might be relevant let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devops issue of the Cutter IT Journal is out with guest editor
Patrick Debois. It&amp;rsquo;s available for free download if you provide some
details and contains several articles including process discussion and
case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cutter.com/offers/devopsrevolution.html&quot;&gt;http://www.cutter.com/offers/devopsrevolution.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a particularly large and dynamic puppet install you
might decide that using the FQDN has some limitations around every node
needing a sensible DNS entry. This article discusses a different
approach using UUIDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetize.me/2011/09/05/using-uuids-for-agent-certnames/&quot;&gt;http://puppetize.me/2011/09/05/using-uuids-for-agent-certnames/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more weekly niche newsletters have launched recently that might be
of interest to devops folks interested in Perl or NoSQL data stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://perlweekly.com/&quot;&gt;http://perlweekly.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nosqlweekly.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.nosqlweekly.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like articles that go into detail about using a different approach to
solve increasingly common problems, and this article about processing a
large song database using map reduce is great. Increasingly important to
know about as the amount of data we collect increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://musicmachinery.com/2011/09/04/how-to-process-a-million-songs-in-20-minutes/&quot;&gt;http://musicmachinery.com/2011/09/04/how-to-process-a-million-songs-in-20-minutes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started with Chef or Puppet is probably the hard part, so
detailed walkthroughs like this are particularly valuable. This post
covers writing a Chef cookbook, with lots of code examples and lots of
discussion and the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/guide-to-writing-chef-cookbooks&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/guide-to-writing-chef-cookbooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article introducing jitter as something you might want to measure
when looking at performance. Jitter is an unpredictable variation in
response, so reducing it is subtly different to reducing response time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/09/06/jitter.html&quot;&gt;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/09/06/jitter.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone doing any on-call support of a software application will probably
find this article, and the paper it references, interesting. Briefly
talks about the difference between fault tolerance and fault protection,
and how that frames when you and how you&amp;rsquo;re altering system should call
a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/09/08/fault-tolerance-and-protection/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/09/08/fault-tolerance-and-protection/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is pretty interesting, but with all the moving parts it&amp;rsquo;s not
the easiest thing to get up and running. The next release of Ubuntu
(Oneiric Ocelot) ships with a full set of packages for running
everything. And this post shows you how to install and run them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A event that might be of interest to readers in London is CITCON
(Continuous Integration and Testing Conference) . It brings together
people from every corner of the software development industry to discuss
continuous integration and the type of testing that goes along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://citconf.com/london2011/&quot;&gt;http://citconf.com/london2011/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another devops flavoured conference is coming to Chicago in October on
the 22nd and 23rd. It&amp;rsquo;s focused on automation and tools and early bird
prices are available until the 15th of September too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://campdevops.com/&quot;&gt;http://campdevops.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves backups, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure anyone really likes setting
them up and monitoring them. This project might be of interest depending
on your requirements. It provides a large range of backup methods for
several databases, along with different off site locations and syncing
mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 37 &amp;ndash; 4th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the biggest issue this week but a few good posts and tools,
especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using Chef. That&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been busier than
usual this week rather than a lack of content, so if you spot, write or
build anything you think would be worth including do email me at
&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#x67;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x68;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x76;&amp;#x65;&amp;#110;&amp;#46;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x67;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#x40;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#104;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x73;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x74;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One think I&amp;rsquo;ve really liked about the nascent Devops community has been
it&amp;rsquo;s reaction to criticism. This week an article from The IT Skeptic
raised a number of issues, some of which had more to do with a seemingly
anti-agile leaning. What was more interesting was the comments and a
follow up post by Ernest Mueller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itskeptic.org/devops-and-traditional-itsm-why-devops-wont-change&quot;&gt;http://www.itskeptic.org/devops-and-traditional-itsm-why-devops-wont-change&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/02/addressing-the-it-skeptics-view-on-devops/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/02/addressing-the-it-skeptics-view-on-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things no-one surely likes about Nagios is writing the
configuration files by hand. This article from the folks at Fotopedia
shows how they are using Chef to generate the Nagios configs, something
that makes it much more likely you&amp;rsquo;ll add checks in the first place.
Lots of code examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.fotopedia.com/2011/08/nagios-and-chef-at-fotopedia.html?m=1&quot;&gt;http://code.fotopedia.com/2011/08/nagios-and-chef-at-fotopedia.html?m=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice looking presentation from the people at Slideshare at Devopsdays
Bangalore. A nice, honest, success story, and one that&amp;rsquo;s not scared of
revealing how messed up things had been. From zero deployments in four
months to five times a day. all with better uptime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/kapil/devops-at-slideshare-talk-at-devopsdays-bangalore-2011&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/kapil/devops-at-slideshare-talk-at-devopsdays-bangalore-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although everyone&amp;rsquo;s operating environment is similar and tools can often
just slot straight in, some industries or companies come with pretty
specific requirements. Picklive are using Chef but had some additional
needs around everything being over SSL and not displaying stack traces.
An interesting blog post resulted about how they dealt with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.picklive.com/2011/09/02/chef-on-steroids.html&quot;&gt;http://tech.picklive.com/2011/09/02/chef-on-steroids.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presentation from InfoQ by Chris Read and Dan North on Agile Operations.
Worth watching if only for the synchronised fairy tale reading at the
start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Agile-Operations-Optimizing-Business&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Agile-Operations-Optimizing-Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppetlabs have released version 1.2 of their Puppet Enterprise product.
It now ships with even more compliance related tools as well as the
managed installer for all the components and professional support as
before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-puppet-enterprise-1-2/?utm_campaign=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=socnet&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-puppet-enterprise-1-2/?utm_campaign=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=socnet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlas from Ning is a tool used to define a template for systems which
can be instantiated, torn down and upgraded. It uses Chef in the middle,
but provides a DSL onto fro describing a system &amp;ndash; so at at slightly
different abstraction level closer to something like CloudFormation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.ning.com/2011/06/atlas-2/&quot;&gt;http://code.ning.com/2011/06/atlas-2/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ning/atlas/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ning/atlas/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spice looks to be a new project aimed at giving you a API for
integrating with a Chef server. Not many examples yet but worth keeping
any eye on if you&amp;rsquo;re building tools around Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danryan/spice&quot;&gt;https://github.com/danryan/spice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone thinking of coming along to the next devopsdays event in Goteborg
in October might want to know that the early bird ticket price is due to
end on 1st of September. And anyone still thinking of submitting a talk
idea needs to do so before the 15th of September.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/.&quot;&gt;http://www.devopsdays.org/.&lt;/a&gt; See everyone there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great presentation from Froscon by Kris Buytaert entitled Devops,
Devops, Devops. It&amp;rsquo;s another nice introduction to the topic and a call
to get involved in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/KrisBuytaert/devops-devops-devops-at-froscon&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/KrisBuytaert/devops-devops-devops-at-froscon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting blog post on what is termed here the configuration
management divide, partly focusing on getting developers and sysadmins
collaborating on config management, and why the deployment story
sometimes gets in the way. I have some thoughts and code on this I need
to write up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/08/22/the-configuration-management-divide/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/08/22/the-configuration-management-divide/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article by Luke Kanies of Puppet Labs which, as well as being a nice
introduction to devops, reveals some of the results of a recent survey
on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/08/devops-what-it-is-why-it-exist.php&quot;&gt;http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/08/devops-what-it-is-why-it-exist.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When and what to virtualise is a question that needs dealing with in
most environments, and this article covers a few basic issues, along
with some recommendations and opinions. Worth reading if it&amp;rsquo;s something
you&amp;rsquo;re new to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scalingexperts.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/the-correct-way-to-use-virtualization/&quot;&gt;http://scalingexperts.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/the-correct-way-to-use-virtualization/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone chooses to use a puppetmaster when using puppet, and this
article covers a simple approach to kicking of puppet runs using Fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magpiebrain.com/2011/08/21/using-fabric-to-apply-puppet-scripts/&quot;&gt;http://www.magpiebrain.com/2011/08/21/using-fabric-to-apply-puppet-scripts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of the videos from Devops Down Under are now available. They
include talks on Kanban for IT Operations, feature flipping, building
high-performing teams and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/devopsdownunder/videos&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/devopsdownunder/videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon continue adding popular services to those available in EC2, this
week rolling out Elasticache. It&amp;rsquo;s an in-memory cache which talks the
memcached protocol, so if you&amp;rsquo;re already using memcached instances on
EC2 it should be simple to try this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/08/amazon-elasticache-distributed-in-memory-caching.html&quot;&gt;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/08/amazon-elasticache-distributed-in-memory-caching.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say the explosion of ops tools hasn&amp;rsquo;t really hit the shores
of those working in a Windows environment. This article takes a look at
this issue and outlines why some Windows only tools right now would be a
good step forward and make some of the problems easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://readsource.co.uk/2011/08/23/a-vision-for-configuration-management-on-windows/&quot;&gt;http://readsource.co.uk/2011/08/23/a-vision-for-configuration-management-on-windows/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever needed to spread execution of commands across a few
servers? Well this article looks at that problem with 10,000 servers and
shows a few approaches, with code and graphed results, of how one team
approached the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/ServerLoadSpreading&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/ServerLoadSpreading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice in-depth article on managing your personal workstation using
Chef, written by a self confessed newbie to all things configuration
management. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty good introduction to some of the Chef
moving parts too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unwiredcouch.com/2011/08/25/setting-up-workstations-with-chef-newbie-edition.html&quot;&gt;http://unwiredcouch.com/2011/08/25/setting-up-workstations-with-chef-newbie-edition.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting piece on the benefits of continuous deployment. It&amp;rsquo;s a
little focused on engineer driven startups but still covers some of the
reasons why investing in the tools to deploy this way lead to more
important cultural changes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benmgreene.com/post/9295282784/why-continuous-deployment-matters&quot;&gt;http://www.benmgreene.com/post/9295282784/why-continuous-deployment-matters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the puppet lint tool from last week, this week I came
across some rspec matches for testing puppet modules. After quite a bit
of talk about testing configuration management code we now have quite a
range of tools to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of applications exposing information about themselves
over http, and Insight looks a nice dashboard for displaying this sort
of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ryangreenhall.com/2011/08/introducing-insight-a-dashboard-to-collate-status-information-from-multiple-application-instances/&quot;&gt;http://www.ryangreenhall.com/2011/08/introducing-insight-a-dashboard-to-collate-status-information-from-multiple-application-instances/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks have been getting interested in node.js, and quite a few
of the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve featured in this newsletter over the weeks have used
node. Anyone put off by javascript though might find node.x of interest.
It&amp;rsquo;s basically a node port to the JVM, currently with examples in Jruby
and Groovy with more planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/purplefox/node.x&quot;&gt;https://github.com/purplefox/node.x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using VMWare fusion but looking wishing for a nice command
line interface then fission might be exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 35 &amp;ndash; 21st August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it was about this week but lots of the articles I came
across were about systems orchestration. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a hot topic,
with more tools and more discussion coming along all the time. I&amp;rsquo;m
making sense of that with the help of this nice graphic from Canonical
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ensemble.ubuntu.com/DevOps&quot;&gt;https://ensemble.ubuntu.com/DevOps&lt;/a&gt; which I really want on a T-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Cafe is back in the form of Devops Drop, an under 10 minutes
podcast filled with discussion and news from John Willis and Damon
Edwards. In three days we&amp;rsquo;ve seen three episodes covering details of
crowbar, cloudfoundry, dynect, netflix, hack day and lots more. Looking
forward to future episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/17/devops-drop-001.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/17/devops-drop-001.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/18/devops-drop-002.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/18/devops-drop-002.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/19/devops-drop-003.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/19/devops-drop-003.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great series of posts about what I think is a very common setup &amp;ndash;
namely a redundant six machine web application cluster. Goes over the
basics of load balancing, redundant database setup and even goes into
the costs associated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rackerhacker.com/redundant-cloud-hosting-configuration-guide/&quot;&gt;http://rackerhacker.com/redundant-cloud-hosting-configuration-guide/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensemble looks to be interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s being developed by Canonical and
is another tool aimed at orchestrating applications across multiple
servers. It will be available in Ubuntu 11.10 or you can get it from a
PPA now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/08/ensemble-the-service-orchestration-framework-for-hard-core-devops/&quot;&gt;http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/08/ensemble-the-service-orchestration-framework-for-hard-core-devops/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ensemble.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;https://ensemble.ubuntu.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upstart is an event-based replacement for the the init daemon which
appears to be picking up lots of fans. It also has unbelievably good
documentation all in one place. This huge page covers why it exists, how
to use it and lots of cookbook style patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/&quot;&gt;http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice quick presentation entitled Mastering Complex Deployments.
Covering what the problems are, why they are unlikely to go away and
what we can do about them. I particularly like the line &amp;ldquo;Relentlessly
Remove Variation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/Urbancode/mastering-complexdeployments&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/Urbancode/mastering-complexdeployments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing what appears to be a theme this week, I came across a nice
introductory article on Mcollective. Describing the problems simply and
showing examples of some of the bundled tools. A good starting point if
you&amp;rsquo;ve yet to look into Mcollective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redbluemagenta.com/2011/08/19/mcollective/&quot;&gt;http://redbluemagenta.com/2011/08/19/mcollective/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcollective is often thought to be a Puppet specific tool, especially
after it moved house to Puppetlabs. But nothing is really Puppet
specific, as this post shows. As well as quickly presenting Mcollective
this article covers some basic Chef integration and points out a few
things that need addressing. I particularly like that a Vagrant box is
provided for anyone to experiment with themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptocracy.com/using-mcollective-with-chef&quot;&gt;http://www.cryptocracy.com/using-mcollective-with-chef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article aimed at CIO&amp;rsquo;s and business folk on bridging the dev and
ops divide. It breaks things down to six elements, which really all come
down to improving collaboration, communication and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cio.com/article/688026/How_To_Improve_Collaboration_with_Development_and_Operations&quot;&gt;http://www.cio.com/article/688026/How_To_Improve_Collaboration_with_Development_and_Operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cox Media Group is looking for a passionate senior engineer who wants a
large role in architecting and implementing our continuous deployment
process. We&amp;rsquo;re using Python, Django, Git, Puppet, Postgres and RabbitMQ
to build out one of the largest media platforms for more than 120 sites.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got the backing of a billion dollar company, but the freedom and
flexibility to move fast and break new ground. We&amp;rsquo;re located in Atlanta,
GA but teleworking is an option for the right candidates. If this sounds
appealing or you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more contact &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#97;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#x6a;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#104;&amp;#110;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#121;&amp;#46;&amp;#x70;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#121;&amp;#x65;&amp;#114;&amp;#64;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#x78;&amp;#x69;&amp;#110;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#99;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x6a;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#104;&amp;#110;&amp;#110;&amp;#x79;&amp;#46;&amp;#112;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#121;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x78;&amp;#x69;&amp;#110;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pencil is a dashboard building tool for use with Graphite. I
particularly like the idea of being able to turn a relative timeslice
(say the last 8 hours) into an absolute one for placing a URL in bug
reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fetep/pencil&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fetep/pencil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lint tools can be really handy, both when learning a new language and
especially when refactoring. So it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see a lint tool for puppet
being worked on. It would be nice to see some documentation and details
of what it&amp;rsquo;s checking but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that will come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the good fortune this week of speaking to a room filled with
developers at the London Ruby User Group. What struck me was that lots
of people have yet to join the discussion around devops tools and ideas,
and at the same time lots of people are very interested. Hopefully a few
of those folks are reading this this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I forgot to mention the addition of encrypted data bags to Chef
when they were released. To make up for that omission here&amp;rsquo;s a nice
worked example of using the new feature to prevent you storing a
cleartext password in your recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/64227128&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/64227128&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix have written a little about their build pipeline, which is based
around creating custom AMI&amp;rsquo;s for deployment on EC2. They prevent any and
all changes to these images once mastered, which prevents any changes to
configuration later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/08/building-with-legos.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/08/building-with-legos.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice folks at Forward have started posting videos of some of their
internal tech talks, including this one about autoscaling with Puppet by
Ryan Conway. It&amp;rsquo;s just ten minutes long so worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/27335693&quot;&gt;http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/27335693&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent London Ruby User Group took on a bit of a devops feel, with
presentations about Puppet and one about Vagrant, Chef and local
development environments from myself. Skills Matter who kindly provide
the venue had videos of the talks up the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skillsmatter.com/event/home/lrug-puppet&quot;&gt;http://skillsmatter.com/event/home/lrug-puppet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent presentation by Patrick Debois and Julian Simpson covering all
things infrastructure as code. It dives into creating base boxes for
vagrant, using mccloud to fire up EC2 instances and shows examples of
using Cucumber-Nagios for alerting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/continuous-integration-for-the-world-infrastructure-as-code&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/continuous-integration-for-the-world-infrastructure-as-code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting ideas talking the technical dept ideas popular when
discussing agile software delivery and applying them to the types of
problem devops techniques aim to solve. The idea of using this when
trying to get buy-in to projects sounds a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/8/9/devops-and-technical-debt-a-debt-crisis-in-your-workplace.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/8/9/devops-and-technical-debt-a-debt-crisis-in-your-workplace.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chef 0.10.4 is out, and looks to be a must have release for anyone
running Redhat based distributions. Lots of bug fixes and lots more
performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/08/11/chef-0-10-4-released/&quot;&gt;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/08/11/chef-0-10-4-released/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capistrano is a great tool, but once you have more than a few hosts the
configuration can get out of hand &amp;ndash; especially if it&amp;rsquo;s duplicating that
already stored in Chef or Puppet or similar. Capistano-Cobbler is a tool
which can extract the required host information from a Cobbler server,
meaning less duplication and more dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/proffalken/capistrano-cobbler&quot;&gt;https://github.com/proffalken/capistrano-cobbler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your source control system has lots of interesting information locked up
in it&amp;rsquo;s meta data, and Metior looks an interesting tool for extracting
some of that if you&amp;rsquo;re using Git. It provides a Ruby library for
generating reports and accessing quite fine grained metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 33 &amp;ndash; 7th August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a quick break from the news and releases, I have to give special
mention this week to John Willis for his latest addition to the music of
devops: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebIr4F-vjQ.&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebIr4F-vjQ.&lt;/a&gt; Right, on with the
regular programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the abstracts for PuppetConf have been released. I&amp;rsquo;m
particularly looking forward to the Noah talk, and some of the notes on
Luke Kanies' keynote sound interesting; a move into application
management and how puppet can be smaller, faster, and easier to
integrate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetconf.com/speakers/&quot;&gt;http://puppetconf.com/speakers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience with Chef has been that you really only get the benefits
if you understand all the different moving parts and how they tie
together. I came across a useful representation of this architecture on
the much improved Chef wiki this week, specifically everything mapped
out using UML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Concepts+as+UML&quot;&gt;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Concepts+as+UML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m guessing most of the readers of this newsletter spend a lot of their
time on the command line. So I&amp;rsquo;m always happy when I find people talking
about user interface issues and design guidelines for command line
applications. Next time you&amp;rsquo;re building a little application try and
remember some of the guidelines on this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antoarts.com/designing-command-line-interfaces/&quot;&gt;http://www.antoarts.com/designing-command-line-interfaces/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to see what technologies and movements other
people find interesting, and the Thoughworks technology radar is a nice
example. Infrastructure as code, Continuous deployment and Devops ideas
feature prominently alongside lots of other things I&amp;rsquo;m fond of that I
want to see more people using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoughtworks.com/articles/technology-radar-july-2011&quot;&gt;http://www.thoughtworks.com/articles/technology-radar-july-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good argument that reaching some areas of the wider systems
administration ecosystem with devops ideas might be much harder that you
might think. The reluctance for some to write code in any form is
pointed out, as is the scarcity of people who make good systems
programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.citrix.com/2011/07/29/the-reluctance-to-code-is-devops-doomed/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.citrix.com/2011/07/29/the-reluctance-to-code-is-devops-doomed/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of Polyglot programmers has been popular for a while, with more
new languages seemingly becoming popular overnight. This post from
Heroku talks about what that means for your typical deployment and
operating infrastructure. The table comparing different languages and
the duplication of tools is interesting, as is the call for more
language-neutral interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/3/polyglot_platform/&quot;&gt;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/3/polyglot_platform/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the face of it EC2 reserved instances look like a great way of
reducing the cost of running in EC2. This post however argues that a
hidden cost of reserved instances is the lack of flexibility. If you&amp;rsquo;re
just using EC2 to bring up a relatively stable number and type of
instance then reserved instances can work but you&amp;rsquo;re not getting the
full benefit of the cloud environment. If your cluster is much more
dynamic then reserved instances might not save you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/03/31/why-amazon-reserve-instances-torment-me/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/03/31/why-amazon-reserve-instances-torment-me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hour long video from Damon Edwards talking devops and system
architecture with Ernest Mueller and Peco Karayanev of National
Instruments. It should be particularly interesting to anyone working
inside a large organisation as lots of the conversation is about how to
make positive changes and get everyone involved in delivery and
operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/7/12/devops-in-the-enterprise-whiteboard-session-at-national-inst.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/7/12/devops-in-the-enterprise-whiteboard-session-at-national-inst.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in the fight between continuous integration and
feature branches. It feels to me that we need more discussion from both
sides on this issue, partly because I see the same thing pointed out in
the Thoughtworks technology radar &amp;ndash; that as developers we&amp;rsquo;re branching
and merging more because the latest tools make it easy to do so. Martin
Fowlers piece on one of the problems with a branch heavy approach makes
interesting reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticConflict.html&quot;&gt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticConflict.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrenza need some help with the Sport Relief 2012 platform build, and
are looking for contract or permanent Chef lovers.
&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#58;&amp;#105;&amp;#x77;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x74;&amp;#116;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x77;&amp;#111;&amp;#x72;&amp;#107;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x61;&amp;#114;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#110;&amp;#x7a;&amp;#x61;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#105;&amp;#x77;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#116;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x77;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#107;&amp;#64;&amp;#99;&amp;#97;&amp;#x72;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#122;&amp;#97;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling charitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This section is sponsored, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in featuring a job get
in touch at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#x61;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#x67;&amp;#97;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#104;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x76;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#110;&amp;#x65;&amp;#116;&quot;&gt;&amp;#103;&amp;#97;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x74;&amp;#104;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#x65;&amp;#118;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of writing tests for configuration management tools is talked
about a lot, and chef spec looks an interesting approach if you&amp;rsquo;re using
Chef. For a new project the documentation is also great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acrmp.github.com/chefspec/&quot;&gt;http://acrmp.github.com/chefspec/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porkshop describes itself as a simple network-based system information
server. Install it on your servers and it exposes information about the
host over a simple HTTP interface. Plugins look simple enough to write
too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/disqus/porkchop&quot;&gt;https://github.com/disqus/porkchop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bunraku is a simple status panel for puppet, hooking into the puppet
reporting facility and storing information in Redis. It&amp;rsquo;s also looks
like it would make a good starting point if you wanted to build you&amp;rsquo;re
own report processing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 32 &amp;#8211; 31st July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A busy week for content, only partly down to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OSCON&lt;/span&gt; it seems. Hopefully you&amp;#8217;ll have time to read a selection of introductions, delve into a few publicly available Puppet and Chef repositories and add a few new tools to your toolbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fantastic article by Mathias Meyer entitled Web Operations 101 For Developers. It really is a great introduction to operations and associated concerns from those coming from a development background. Definitely worth circulating amongst your work colleagues whichever side of the tracks you&amp;#8217;re from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/7/25/web_operations_101_for_developers.html&quot;&gt;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/7/25/web_operations_101_for_developers.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more tools are coming with rich API&amp;#8217;s, often exposing data as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;. Familiar tools like grep can be used on this data but in a fairly brute force way, they have no understanding of the overall document structure. That&amp;#8217;s where jgrep from Pieter Loubser comes in. Here&amp;#8217;s some useful examples from R.I. Pienaar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/07/29/rich-data-on-the-cli.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/07/29/rich-data-on-the-cli.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like Ben Rockwood has stumbled upon a treasure trove of useful reading material for anyone interested in the management/process side of devops. A fantastic post for anyone in search of a solid list of book recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cuddletech.com/blog/?p=642&quot;&gt;http://cuddletech.com/blog/?p=642&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning a new tool it&amp;#8217;s often useful to see more than just simple examples, and be able to explore an entire project. Open source is generally very good at libraries, examples and tools, less so on entire working code bases. So I enjoyed looking through the a Chef repository in use at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CERN&lt;/span&gt; and the Debian project puppet repo this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.hep.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;http://code.hep.wisc.edu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=mirror/dsa-puppet.git;a=summary&quot;&gt;http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=mirror/dsa-puppet.git;a=summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to forget that the Vagrant configuration file is just Ruby, which means you can do some quite simple optimisations for multi-box environments. This Gist shows a quick example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1108747&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/1108747&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great talk from Jordan Sissel at Oscon on Logstash and where it&amp;#8217;s aiming to fit into the whole logging puzzle. The slides themselves are worth going through anyway, but you can also get the speakers notes (from the actions button at the bottom) which give more background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfNjV3bXFnNHNnbQ&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;pli=1&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfNjV3bXFnNHNnbQ&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;pli=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another What is Devops post, but one that acts as a bit of a history up till now for those that are just hearing about the term. It&amp;#8217;s also nicely written and balanced, mentioning both positive and negative points, all in a very readable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev-spout.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-is-devops.html&quot;&gt;http://dev-spout.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-is-devops.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Joel Test is well known amongst developers as an opinionated but useful quick look at what you can improve across a software team. Thomas Limoncelli has just published a similar list of systems administration. It comprises 32 questions (which is probably a few too many to be quick in my opinion) that you can use to pin point areas to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/the-test.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/the-test.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly what your configuration management tool should manage has been a hot topic of late, with several good discussions that I&amp;#8217;m aware of about packages vs configuration. This article from Sean OMeara explains the approach he prefers, which I thought was neatly summed up by &amp;#8220;Don’t edit config files. Instead, edit the truth.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/8140290279/configuration-management-strategies&quot;&gt;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/8140290279/configuration-management-strategies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A worthwhile article that talks about the different audiences for packaging, praising both apt for its features and tools like Leiningen for solving developers problems. Leiningen is a clojure tool similar in purpose to Bundler, and interestingly it&amp;#8217;s in the process of being packaged for Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technomancy.us/151&quot;&gt;http://technomancy.us/151&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabled deployinator, Etsy&amp;#8217;s inhouse deployment tool, has been open sourced as mentioned last week. The code is on GitHub and more documentation is being added all the time. I&amp;#8217;d love someone to write up experiences of getting this up and running and where they see it fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/deployinator&quot;&gt;https://github.com/etsy/deployinator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell have open sourced a tool they have been using to bring up a multi-node OpenStack cloud on bare metal. It appears to use Chef under the hood. Worth a look if you&amp;#8217;re wanting to investigate OpenStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bartongeorge.net/2011/07/26/dell-announces-availability-of-openstack-solution-open-sources-crowbar-software-framework/&quot;&gt;http://bartongeorge.net/2011/07/26/dell-announces-availability-of-openstack-solution-open-sources-crowbar-software-framework/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 31 &amp;#8211; 24th July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This issue is dedicated to all those who call themselves system administrators, because this Friday it&amp;#8217;s System Administrator Appreciation Day http://sysadminday.com/. Devops is all about communication so if you&amp;#8217;re not already best friends with your sysadmin colleagues go strike up a conversation this week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Debois gave what looks to have been a fantastic presentation at devopsdownunder last week. Devops, what&amp;#8217;s in a word?, counters in plain terms all the arguments against devops in one slide deck. This will probably become my reference when I have those tricky conversations about why I find the devops movement interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devopsdays-downundervfinal&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devopsdays-downundervfinal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #monitoringsucks &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; chat happened last week, and John has written up the notes. It turns out naming things is hard, but the post is a good start, and mapping these terms to existing tools is a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/07/monitoring-sucks-watch-your-language.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/07/monitoring-sucks-watch-your-language.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Allspaw appears to spend his time reading some rather interesting material. Here&amp;#8217;s a section taken from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Systems Engineering handbook, which describes rather brilliantly what a systems engineer is. I&amp;#8217;m sure lots of people will look at this and find it a pretty good description of what they do with software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When identifying what&amp;#8217;s causing your web application to perform badly, it&amp;#8217;s often the database that&amp;#8217;s the first to be blamed. This article covers why this is and some of the things you can do to help diagnose the actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m quite a fan of High Scalability posts, especially those that are basically lists of interesting facts about a companies architecture. New Relic reveal all sorts of interesting facts, in particular about how they deal with the database side of such a write heavy application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix have previously written about the Chaos Monkey, a tool for keeping them honest when it comes to cloud redundancy. They have been taking this approach further, with tools introducing latency, taking down entire availability zones and checking security and conformance criteria. I&amp;#8217;d love to see some of these open sourced eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice details writeup and presentation of using a Kanban system in an operations team. This post covers what the team at realestate.com.au have learned, and includes lots of photos that really help make sense of the system they adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Velocity Conference is set to hit Europe, specifically Berlin on 8th and 9th of November. The Call for Papers is out now, you have until the 8th of August to get your talk ideas submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is spawning more plugins as well, I came across vagrant-hosts this week that automatically add or remove local hosts entries when bringing up or shutting down machines with vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dwt/vagrant-hosts&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dwt/vagrant-hosts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re looking for a web based application to manage your virtual machines, then Archipel might be of interest. It uses an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XMPP&lt;/span&gt; daemon installed on each machine for communication and supports everything via libvert. It&amp;#8217;s open source as too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archipelproject.org/&quot;&gt;http://archipelproject.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dew is an environment management tool intended for use in multi-instance &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; application deployments. It takes a single configuration file and provides commands to create and manage a number of newly created instances in a similar way to Amazon&amp;#8217;s own CloudFormation. I&amp;#8217;d love to see a bit more documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/playup/dew&quot;&gt;https://github.com/playup/dew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etsy have released the tools they use for AB testing, multivariate testing and various other flavours of experimental feature release. It&amp;#8217;s a collection of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; classes, but I would love to see implementations in other languages and frameworks. Looks like Etsy are also planning on open sourcing deployinator at some point too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 30 &amp;#8211; 17th July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to lots of new readers this week. More new readers in fact that any other week since the first. Hopefully the collection of tools and news will prove useful. And if anyone has any good links do let me know at gareth@morethanseven.net&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John E. Vincent has continued driving the #monitoringsucks discussion, and is organising another &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; chat. This time it&amp;#8217;s likely to be more focused on producing things that help with any resulting hacking. After a quick vote the chat has been organised for Thursday, July 21st at 5:00 PM &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt; so should be good for those in the US and Europe hopefully. A further chat for those closer to Australia who will likely be asleep is in the works too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/07/monitoring-sucks-round-2-fight.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/07/monitoring-sucks-round-2-fight.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Ray has taken a look at the terminology around discussing monitoring. Agreeing on words and concepts will be pretty important if the whole #monitoringsucks explosion of compatible tools and services is to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leastresistance.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/monitoringsucks-terminology-first-stab/&quot;&gt;https://leastresistance.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/monitoringsucks-terminology-first-stab/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been doing more with Jenkins again recently and came across the excellent Build Pipeline plugin. If you&amp;#8217;ve read the Continuous Delivery book you&amp;#8217;ll be familiar with the term, but at a basic level it&amp;#8217;s using downstream builds to define a deployment workflow. With the plugin you get a very nice visualisation and importantly the ability to introduce manual gates (for instance for a QA check on staging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Pipeline+Plugin&quot;&gt;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JENKINS&lt;/span&gt;/Build+Pipeline+Plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid evolution of career paths is an interesting aside to the growth of devops, but where are the next generation going to come from. A nice post enthusing about the role of the system administrator, why you might want to be one, and how you can get started. I think personally I&amp;#8217;d have added something about learning to programme as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://silverwraith.com/blog/2011/07/so-you-want-to-be-a-systems-administrator/&quot;&gt;http://silverwraith.com/blog/2011/07/so-you-want-to-be-a-systems-administrator/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monitoring discussions this week prompted me to look around for other new contenders, and I found Critical from Dan DeLeo of Opscode. It features a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt; for describing metrics and the monitoring of those metrics. Definitely worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielsdeleo/critical&quot;&gt;https://github.com/danielsdeleo/critical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more folks are using Graphite it seems for storing ad-hoc metrics data. Diamond is a python based daemon for collecting and publishing metrics including cpu, memory, network, i/o, load and disk data. It also has a simple &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for more custom data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.brightcove.com/project/Diamond/&quot;&gt;http://opensource.brightcove.com/project/Diamond/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you get more data into Graphite you might want to alert on it from Nagios. Very similar to the check_ganglia command, check_graphite is a Nagios plugin that takes an average data point from graphite and compares it to a threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 29 &amp;#8211; 10th July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slightly quieter week this time, which probably means lots of people are off enjoying a much needed holiday. Hopefully with all that free time readers are plotting even more tools and blog posts right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glu is the deployment framework open sourced by LinkedIn, and this video of its creator Yan Pujante talking at a Chicago DevOps event is worth watching. Good demo explaining where it fits in and some good insights into the scale at which LinkedIn are working at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/07/09/glu-deployment-automation-video/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/07/09/glu-deployment-automation-video/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#8217;re deploying more often we&amp;#8217;re probably generating more and more deployment artefacts. The question then is how long to store them? This article by Dave Farley goes into the different types of artefacts we&amp;#8217;re creating and what we might want to keep around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agile.dzone.com/news/how-long-retain-build-output&quot;&gt;http://agile.dzone.com/news/how-long-retain-build-output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikolay Sturm has recently started a new job, and is documenting the context surrounding man of the emerging devops best practices we hear lots about. So far covering branching and configuration management, with hopefully more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nistu.de/tags/devops%20toolbox/&quot;&gt;http://blog.nistu.de/tags/devops%20toolbox/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice viewpoint from Philip J. Hollenback on devops. In particular coming to the term via the tools and later realising that it&amp;#8217;s really more about people and working together. Or more specifically DevOps Means Don&amp;#8217;t Be an A-hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/DevOpsMeansDontBeAnAhole&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/DevOpsMeansDontBeAnAhole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is using Chef or Puppet for managing configuration files on a number of servers. WooMe take nearly the opposite approach, configuring the individual boxes, storing those files in mercurial repositories and then aggregating all those repos and the changes to a central machine for viewing as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://making.dev.woome.com/post/7299452441/lazy-devops-config-recoverability-with-mercurial&quot;&gt;http://making.dev.woome.com/post/7299452441/lazy-devops-config-recoverability-with-mercurial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s commonly held that we need new approaches to monitoring, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSAC&lt;/span&gt; is Dean Wilson&amp;#8217;s take on the subject. At the moment we have high level diagrams of how a monitoring system could work, with code coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/introduction-to-dsac.html&quot;&gt;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/introduction-to-dsac.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks are hacking on new approaches to monitoring it seems. As predominantly a developer I personally quite like the idea of checks as unit tests, and PagerUnit from Richard Crowley takes that approach. Write some python tests, and have PagerUnit run them every 10 seconds and email you if they fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rcrowley/pagerunit&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rcrowley/pagerunit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tool from Richard is python-cloudformation, a python library for creating &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; CloudFormation templates. Not much documentation yet but see the linked example for an idea of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/devstructure/python-cloudformation&quot;&gt;https://github.com/devstructure/python-cloudformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeolus is a tool from RedHat designed to easy managing cloud instances or virtual machines across different internal and external providers. It provides a browser based dashboard for firing up and managing new machines. With support for Eucalyptus, VMware vSphere, Rackspace, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; and more it might be useful for some folks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 28 &amp;#8211; 3rd July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lots of events news this week, along with a load of videos from various recent events. I&amp;#8217;ll be at the next London Devops event and in Goteburg later in the year, hopefully see a few people at both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration is now open for Devops Days Europe in Goteborg. $120 for 2 days is great value, and with only 150 people attending it should be quite a good event for indepth discussions. See you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/registration/&quot;&gt;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/registration/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next London Devops event is now open for signup. The event is free to attend and will be on the 25th July 2011. The nice folks at Forward are sponsoring and providing a really nice space. If you&amp;#8217;re in London do come along. We&amp;#8217;re still looking for more speakers so if you&amp;#8217;re interested get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://londondevops.eventwax.com/devops-talks-back&quot;&gt;https://londondevops.eventwax.com/devops-talks-back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos from sessions at Devops Days Mountain View have been posted online. Talks and discussions on Kanban, QA, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; Caching, Orchestration and more. Lots to catch up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/tag/devops-days-mv-2011-video&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/tag/devops-days-mv-2011-video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finding more and more videos with great content recently, including this talk from QCon by Jez Humble on minimising risk when releasing software. Worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Remediation-Patterns&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Remediation-Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More videos from Damon Edwards, this time two videos from a visit to Etsy and discussions with John Allspaw. Two quick videos discussing metrics and what to put on developer and operations dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/6/24/video-with-john-allspaw-at-etsy-what-to-put-on-the-big-dashb.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/6/24/video-with-john-allspaw-at-etsy-what-to-put-on-the-big-dashb.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent Heroku release packed in lots of improvements and changes, and this series on some of the underlying principles has been great. This article goes over what they describe as Erosion Resistance of a platform, basically knowing if it works today that it will still work in the future without excessive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/6/28/the_new_heroku_4_erosion_resistance_explicit_contracts/&quot;&gt;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/6/28/the_new_heroku_4_erosion_resistance_explicit_contracts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice article from Ben Rockwood on what he describes as the Three Aspects of DevOps. Breaking the adoption of Devops practices into three phases, with activities under each is a nice high level way of looking for the next step in your team or organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cuddletech.com/blog/?p=624&quot;&gt;http://cuddletech.com/blog/?p=624&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice article by Brian Henerey from Sony on building a new team within the Online Technology Group. Some good tips for anyone involved in hiring and building or improving a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilesysadmin.net/building-a-devops-team&quot;&gt;http://agilesysadmin.net/building-a-devops-team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever building a system it&amp;#8217;s interesting to be able to compare with other similar platforms. Most individuals only have so much experience, so it&amp;#8217;s always nice to see details like these from TripAdvisor published online. Everything from number of service requests, expected response times, size of logs, etc. Lots to dig into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/6/27/tripadvisor-architecture-40m-visitors-200m-dynamic-page-view.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/6/27/tripadvisor-architecture-40m-visitors-200m-dynamic-page-view.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating custom AMIs for EC2 has generally been something I&amp;#8217;ve avoided, but Stem looks an incredibly simply way of creating and launching custom AMIs. A simple command line tool with a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; configuration file. If you&amp;#8217;re using EC2 well worth taking a look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelgorsuch.com/2011/02/27/introduction-to-stem.html&quot;&gt;http://michaelgorsuch.com/2011/02/27/introduction-to-stem.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started with configuration management across a number of machines often requires a bit of setting things up and maybe some money spend on EC2. Chef Box is an interesting project that provides tools for bringing up several Vagrant controlled Ubuntu machines on your desktop, all managed by an Chef server installed on one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure more people are writing more about devops and related topics each week. Either that or I&amp;#8217;m finding more articles each week. Either way here&amp;#8217;s a whole bunch of videos, articles, slide-desks and tools from the last week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of devopsdays in the US, the call for papers has gone out for the upcoming European event in Gothenburg. The theme this year is all about &amp;#8216;inclusive&amp;#8217;, so hopefully lots more talk about the people side of devops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/proposals/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/proposals/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whopping 247 slide desk from John Allspaw presented at Velocity a few weeks ago titled Advanced PostMortem Fu and Human Error 101. Well worth a look, I&amp;#8217;m just hoping the video of this talk makes it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/advanced-postmortem-fu-and-human-error-101-velocity-2011&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/advanced-postmortem-fu-and-human-error-101-velocity-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick gave what looks to have been an excellent talk at devopsdats about where Vagrant fits into a typical development workflow. Well worth a skim through if you&amp;#8217;re not sure yet how local virtualisation tools actually help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/vagrant-devopsdays-mountain-view-2011&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/vagrant-devopsdays-mountain-view-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as slides many of the keynote talks from Velocity are already up for viewing. That&amp;#8217;s a whole 6 hours of video that should keep anyone busy who couldn&amp;#8217;t make it along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=C394849408B5F203&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=C394849408B5F203&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; to download and print from Paul Duvall and DZone focusing on Continuous Delivery. It pulls out lots of the component parts and outlines patterns and anti-patterns that you can strive for or look to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/continuous-delivery-patterns&quot;&gt;http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/continuous-delivery-patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very thorough writeup of an operational problem, from detection through diagnosis and onwards to resolution and root cause analysis. It&amp;#8217;s always illuminating when people go into the details behind even small problems like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omniti.com/seeds/when-things-go-wrong-a-case-study&quot;&gt;http://omniti.com/seeds/when-things-go-wrong-a-case-study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heals of last weeks big Ganglia UI release, Vladimir Vuksan has pushed another super useful feature called Overlay Events. Simply put you can mark events (like deploys or backups) on your graphs when they happen using a simple http based &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Very useful for diagnosing why a metric has just gone haywire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ganglia.info/?p=382&quot;&gt;http://ganglia.info/?p=382&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Newman from Thoughtworks gave a talk at a recent quarterly briefing about DevOps and Continuous Delivery (hit the watch the full briefing button near the top right for the full video).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/push-the-button&quot;&gt;http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/push-the-button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full day free event on OpenStack is happening in London on Jul 13th. Introductory talks, panels and some technical sessions in the afternoon. Looks like it might be worth heading along if you&amp;#8217;re in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emeaopenstackday.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;http://emeaopenstackday.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup from velocity and in particular devopsdays US. Several interesting discussions keep being mentioned by folks who went along, hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll find some more write-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appdynamics.com/blog/2011/06/22/web-ops-to-dev-ops-in-mountain-view/&quot;&gt;http://www.appdynamics.com/blog/2011/06/22/web-ops-to-dev-ops-in-mountain-view/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London CI meetup has been excellent when I&amp;#8217;ve managed to get along, and it&amp;#8217;s always nice when people write up the events afterwards. The last event had Gus Power talking about Continuous Integration, in particular focusing on measuring system acceptance criteria which are often missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesbetteley.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/continuous-integration-the-last-mile/&quot;&gt;http://jamesbetteley.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/continuous-integration-the-last-mile/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet 2.7.0 has been released, including deterministic catalog application, a newly apache licenced codebase, support for Ruby 1.9.2 and the new Puppet Faces &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Well worth upgrading if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/puppet-users/browse_thread/thread/ffe1345c165bf293?pli=1&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/puppet-users/browse_thread/thread/ffe1345c165bf293?pli=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing configuration management code is often discussed but I think it&amp;#8217;s fair to say no one approach or tool has yet won widespread adoption. Chefci looks interesting however, more as one potential approach at this stage. It focuses on solving a specific problem of a development based OS X workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/06/19/issue-26/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/06/19/issue-26</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 26 &amp;#8211; 19th June 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry for the slight delay this week, I&amp;#8217;m just moving into a rather nice new house and hence rather busy. To make up for that this weeks issue is rather jam-packed with interesting content. And I haven&amp;#8217;t even caught up with anything that&amp;#8217;s come out of velocity or devopsdays yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet have announced PuppetConf, a pretty amazing looking multi-track operations conference in Portland from September 19th-23rd. I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited to have been asked to be Master Of Ceremonies for the Devops track, so hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll see a few of you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetconf.com/&quot;&gt;http://puppetconf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new book by Noah Campbell looks interesting, aiming to cover everything about Yum and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; from a clear introduction to using it for application deployment. Three chapters are available to read online so far in draft format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webscalebook.com/&quot;&gt;http://webscalebook.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good overview of how one organisation is currently deploying software. I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of information like this being shared, it gives people lots more chances to learn and to critique others approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperatiOns.com/state-of-development-annual-address-on-how-we-ship-software&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperatiOns.com/state-of-development-annual-address-on-how-we-ship-software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maven might not be everyones favourite tool but it&amp;#8217;s pretty powerful. With that comes complexity, and this book, published on GitHub, looks a nice way of learning the ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buildndeploy/maven-book&quot;&gt;https://github.com/buildndeploy/maven-book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d missed the new relationship syntax in Puppet, but this article shows why it&amp;#8217;s super useful with the example of wanting to run an apt-get update before installing a package. Quick talk of other approaches and then code showing how the relationship approach solves the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://johnleach.co.uk/words/771/puppet-dependencies-and-run-stages&quot;&gt;http://johnleach.co.uk/words/771/puppet-dependencies-and-run-stages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those nice folk at Devstructure would like to show more people how powerful their blueprint tool is. So they are offering to build blueprints for people that contact them with specific architecture problems. I&amp;#8217;d love to see some of the resulting blueprints open sourced so we can all learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.devstructure.com/two-men-and-a-server&quot;&gt;http://blog.devstructure.com/two-men-and-a-server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chef isn&amp;#8217;t just for managing lots of servers, and Joshua&amp;#8217;s latest post shows how he&amp;#8217;s using it to manage his OS X home machines. Some interesting generic recipes referenced that will be useful the next time I manage to get myself a new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/managing-my-workstations-with-chef&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/managing-my-workstations-with-chef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid using the term &amp;#8220;Cloud Computing&amp;#8221; except when being ironic says this post, or rather it points out that for technical discussions we should be more specific about what we mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/06/avoid-using-the-term-cloud-com.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/06/avoid-using-the-term-cloud-com.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how Google go about continuous integration? This post has lots of interesting details about the approach they take to deal with a large volatile codebase. The short version is that they use a dependency graph to only run the tests relevant to the change at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/06/testing-at-speed-and-scale-of-google.html&quot;&gt;http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/06/testing-at-speed-and-scale-of-google.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet will happily watch the status of running services, but under the hood it turns out that it often just does that by looking at the low level process. Dean Wilson points out how to have it use the operating system process management tool, as well as how to write custom checks for even better monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/puppet/smarter-service-status-in-puppet.html&quot;&gt;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/puppet/smarter-service-status-in-puppet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysing log files is fun. But the bigger the log files get the harder the problem becomes, unless you&amp;#8217;re already using something like Hadoop. This article from Troy Davis of PaperTrail shows you how to use Amazon&amp;#8217;s hosted Hadoop and Hive system to analyse logs from S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/analytics/log-analytics-with-hadoop-and-hive&quot;&gt;http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/analytics/log-analytics-with-hadoop-and-hive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganglia Web 2.0 has been released, including the much more functional web front end. You can also now define graphs in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; as well as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, send data easily to Graphite, dynamically build aggregate graphs and access metric data as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ganglia.info/?p=393&quot;&gt;http://ganglia.info/?p=393&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another release from an establish project, the Go release management tool from Thoughtworks Studios has released version 2.2. This release introduces better tools for managing and comparing release pipelines as well as versioning all configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://community.thoughtworks.com/posts/7dcda4ede1&quot;&gt;http://community.thoughtworks.com/posts/7dcda4ede1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misty is a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt; for Amazon&amp;#8217;s Cloud Formation tool from the developers at Forward. It allows you to describe an architecture of EC2 instances and have them come up when commanded. No documentation yet but the example Mistfile from the tests looks interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 25 &amp;#8211; 11th June 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Velocity and devopsdays next week and I&amp;#8217;m guessing a fair few readers will be going along. While you&amp;#8217;re enjoying all the glorious content take a moment to think of everyone who can&amp;#8217;t make it &amp;#8211; and blog and tweet like crazy so we can keep up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out Puppet Labs employ a User Experience Designer, responsible for making the command line, API&amp;#8217;s and the Puppet &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt; as nice to use as they can be. Too many designers miss the potential of command line utilities so this is greta news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/what-is-user-experience-in-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/what-is-user-experience-in-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.I.Pienaar (of mcollective fame) has been very busy this last week. First releasing Hiera, a new hierarchal data store aimed at representing key value data about infrastructure. The following two blog posts go into details about how this can be used with puppet to keep manifests particularly clean and reusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/05/hiera_a_pluggable_hierarchical_data_store.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/05/hiera_a_pluggable_hierarchical_data_store.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/06/puppet_backend_for_hiera.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/06/puppet_backend_for_hiera.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/11/puppet_backend_for_hiera_part_2.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/11/puppet_backend_for_hiera_part_2.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned the growing #monitoringsucks movement in the last few issues. John Vincent has written a good blog post summarising what&amp;#8217;s going on and what he&amp;#8217;d love to see come out of the group. The project now has repos for tools, metrics best practice, irc logs and any blog posts written on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-monitoring-sucks.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-monitoring-sucks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium is a handy tool, but running it in headless mode has often been troublesome. This blog post demonstrates using PyVirtualDisplay, a Python wrapper for Xvfb and Xephyr, to run your tests. If you&amp;#8217;re using Python this looks very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2011/06/python-headless-selenium-webdriver.html&quot;&gt;http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2011/06/python-headless-selenium-webdriver.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this article on the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; Integrated Service Management Blog. Describing devops as &amp;#8220;simultaneously reassuring and terrifying&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s a really interesting, and positive, insight from an experienced outsider. The car analogy is a nice thought as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/59c1123b-0353-458e-a719-b002d84108d5/entry/devops_should_i_have_known_what_that_is1?lang=en_us&quot;&gt;https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/59c1123b-0353-458e-a719-b002d84108d5/entry/devops_should_i_have_known_what_that_is1?lang=en_us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log.io looks an interesting tool for visualising log files in realtime in a browser. It&amp;#8217;s a node.js application that you can host yourself, and it can harvest log files from multiple machines and let you build up views of what you want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://logio.org/&quot;&gt;http://logio.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is spawning a number of useful plugins, and snap is the latest. It provides the ability to take snapshots of virtual machines and then restore back to them, and it usefully supports multi-vm vagrantfiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/t9md/vagrant-snap&quot;&gt;https://github.com/t9md/vagrant-snap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chef.vim is plugin for vim using chef fans. It provides the ability to jump between attributes and recipes and easily open recipes, templates and files in your cookbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 24 &amp;#8211; 4th June 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tell it&amp;#8217;s the summer because of all the conferences it seems. Lots of events are happening around Velocity this year, as well as Devops Down Under in Australia next month. Hopefully that means lots of videos and content for the weeks following those events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Devops Down Under event is now open for registration. It&amp;#8217;s a two day event with scheduled talks and open spaces and is talking place on July 22nd and 23rd in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdownunder.org/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdownunder.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Devops Cafe podcast made a comeback last week and it sounds like it&amp;#8217;s going to be back to being a regular show. This episode features a good discussion with John Vincent about devops in general and noah in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/6/2/episode-18.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/6/2/episode-18.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook have released a video talking about how the Release Engineering team push out changes to Facebook. Lots of interesting details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10100259101684977&amp;amp;oid=9445547199&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10100259101684977&amp;amp;oid=9445547199&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone enjoys managing a Ruby stack, and the recent changes in Rubygems 1.8 have caused people using operating system packaged versions of Ruby some problems. Slimgems is a new project which aims to maintain the old &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; at the same time as providing features and performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gnuu.org/2011/06/01/slimgems-a-drop-in-replacement-for-rubygems/&quot;&gt;http://gnuu.org/2011/06/01/slimgems-a-drop-in-replacement-for-rubygems/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice folks at Devstructure have released Blueprint I/O, a server that allows you to store blueprints in S3 and easily move them around between different servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.devstructure.com/blueprint-io&quot;&gt;http://blog.devstructure.com/blueprint-io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another event, this time in Sunnyvale on June 16th (just after velocity finishes). Following on from a previous night of talking monitoring, this time the same topic but with a ban on talking about Nagios. Sounds fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Area-Large-Scale-Production-Engineering/events/15481164/&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Area-Large-Scale-Production-Engineering/events/15481164/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohsuke Kawaguchi, the creator of Jenkins, was in London last week to do a talk and Maciej Matyjas wrote up a few notes. My favourite quote has to be &amp;#8220;Treat servers like livestock rather than pets&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://matyjas.posterous.com/distributed-builds-with-jenkins-jenkinsci&quot;&gt;http://matyjas.posterous.com/distributed-builds-with-jenkins-jenkinsci&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice comprehensive writeup from the team at Outbrain about monitoring. Contains lots of screen shots from their setup and links to the various tools they are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.outbrain.com/2011/05/monitoring-a-wild-beast/&quot;&gt;http://techblog.outbrain.com/2011/05/monitoring-a-wild-beast/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #monitoringsucks discussion has spawned a useful looking GitHub repo containing links to a large number of existing monitoring tools. Useful if you&amp;#8217;re looking for something specific or seeking inspiration for a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 23 &amp;#8211; 28th May 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another busy week on the internet, including a very interesting discussion about the state of monitoring on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; and twitter using the tag #monitoringsucks. For those who missed it (or like me where asleep because it was the middle of the night) the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; logs are available at https://github.com/monitoringsucks/irc-logs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good story based article from an experienced agile consultant about the often fraught relationship between development and operations groups. Has some interesting things she has tried to encourage better understanding and communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.estherderby.com/2011/03/bridging-structural-conflict-same-and-different.html&quot;&gt;http://www.estherderby.com/2011/03/bridging-structural-conflict-same-and-different.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surge conference on scalability and performance is on again in September, and to show folks what it&amp;#8217;s all about they have kindly released last years speakers videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omniti.com/surge/2010/speakers&quot;&gt;http://omniti.com/surge/2010/speakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroku suffered a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DDOS&lt;/span&gt; attack last week and, after dealing with it, posted some interesting findings and recommendations. In particular they recommend against using bare domain names, instead always using subdomains that can be &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; aliased to their proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://status.heroku.com/incident/156&quot;&gt;http://status.heroku.com/incident/156&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agile Cambridge conference has a call for speakers out until the June 17th, and are specifically looking for Devops flavoured talks. Promoting this is only slightly self-centred, I live in Cambridge and like the idea of interesting folk coming to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilecambridge.net/ac2011/speak.php&quot;&gt;http://www.agilecambridge.net/ac2011/speak.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having something to aim for when you&amp;#8217;re building anything is useful, and this sort list outlines 7 levels of continuous integration. Worthwhile thinking about where you sit and how to reach the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agile.dzone.com/news/7-levels-continuous&quot;&gt;http://agile.dzone.com/news/7-levels-continuous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well written article on common pitfalls when running &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; load tests, done as a set of 10 things you should think about and ideally be doing. Especially useful if you&amp;#8217;re just starting to look at load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/05/18/http_benchmark_rules&quot;&gt;http://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/05/18/http_benchmark_rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good walk-though with code examples for managing a puppet workflow with Capistrano. Featuring the ability to deploy and easily rollback changes to different environments and making use of mcollective to trigger puppet runs across all your machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.threedrunkensysadsonthe.net/2011/05/deploy-and-roll-back-system-configs-with-capistrano-mcollective-and-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://www.threedrunkensysadsonthe.net/2011/05/deploy-and-roll-back-system-configs-with-capistrano-mcollective-and-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people seem to be intrigued with the possibilities of Noah, but most of the examples I&amp;#8217;ve seen have been using Chef. James Turnbull has been putting together some Puppet based examples, including one that queries a Noah server for a host and uses the list of its services to specify which Puppet classes to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kartar.net/2011/05/puppet-noah/&quot;&gt;http://www.kartar.net/2011/05/puppet-noah/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenStack folks have been building their own message queuing system called Burrow aimed at being used in a multi-tenant system. They do a pretty good job of outlining why they went down this route rather than using an existing product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://burrow.openstack.org/overview.html&quot;&gt;http://burrow.openstack.org/overview.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotspots is a very nice looking Rails profiling tool. Add some middleware to collect the data and then run the included command line tool to produce a very comprehensive report. I&amp;#8217;ve been using request_log_analyzer recently too, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see similar tools for other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tmm1/hotspots&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tmm1/hotspots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice blog post by a member of the Economist development team on how they are using Selenium to test code on every commit. In particular they have written a simple &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; application to help with creating a X virtual frame buffer and then using ffmpeg to capture a video of all the tests run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codebaboon.com/economist-testing-drupal-using-selenium&quot;&gt;http://codebaboon.com/economist-testing-drupal-using-selenium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More articles worth reading, events worth attending and tools worth investigating. If only I had time to try out all of the things everyone is publishing or discussing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Devopsdays Europe has a date, Friday 14th and Saturday 15th of October 2011, to go along with the location of Goteborg in Sweden. They are still looking for sponsors so if that&amp;#8217;s you be sure to get in touch with the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/&quot;&gt;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro Puppet is out. James Turnbull has written a follow up to the first Puppet book, this time with much more content and with an index (sorry James). It covers getting started all the way through to using MCollective. Apologies for the affiliate link, it helps pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1430230576/tag=devobook-21&quot;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1430230576/tag=devobook-21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; link I&amp;#8217;ve included I think, but it&amp;#8217;s worth it. The Operating Systems Division of The National Security Agency has published a whopping 200 page guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. If this is a topic you need to know about this looks perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to wager lots of readers spend a great deal of time in the console, and why not when so many powerful tools exist all just a keystroke away? This post is collecting useful command line tools, a few of which I&amp;#8217;d not come across before. Particularly good starting point if you&amp;#8217;re new to the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kkovacs.eu/cool-but-obscure-unix-tools&quot;&gt;http://kkovacs.eu/cool-but-obscure-unix-tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is probably vaguely (or intimately) familiar with the Unix Process model. Adam Wiggins of Heroku has been writing about applying this approach to web applications, in particular as an approach to scaling up a system. The tool mentioned called Foreman looks pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/5/9/applying_the_unix_process_model_to_web_apps/&quot;&gt;http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/5/9/applying_the_unix_process_model_to_web_apps/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice long form article by Jez Humble aimed at CIOs and technical managers. Introducing the ideas behind continuous delivery and other devops tenets, and focusing on the business rationale to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cioupdate.com/trends/article.php/3933106/Tired-of-Playing-Ping-Pong-with-Dev-QA-and-Ops.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.cioupdate.com/trends/article.php/3933106/Tired-of-Playing-Ping-Pong-with-Dev-QA-and-Ops.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice article arguing that, yes, adopting devops practices will probably lead to more work due to unfulfilled demand, but that this is a good thing. And with the right tools, people and processes in place should both drive down costs and drive up profits. Good examples to backup the theme too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-driven-demand&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-driven-demand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easier to build apps upon apps with advances in APIs and simpler to fire up new servers in cloud environments either inside or outside your company. This proliferation and speed makes traditional business continuity planning harder argues this article. Getting ahead of this potential problem is something worth thinking about for any growing organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jpmorgenthal.com/morgenthal/?p=256&quot;&gt;http://www.jpmorgenthal.com/morgenthal/?p=256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having system metrics is important, but without application level monitoring your users can have problems even while you think your servers are fine. This article walks through a great example with graphs and diagrams showing exactly how this comes about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/5/11/troubleshooting-response-time-problems-why-you-cannot-trust.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/5/11/troubleshooting-response-time-problems-why-you-cannot-trust.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FPM&lt;/span&gt; saw a few more releases this last week, amongst other things adding the ability to very easily convert Python packages from PyPi or local directories to DEBs or RPMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/ConvertingPython&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/ConvertingPython&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splinter looks a interesting Python based web functional testing tool. It looks a little like Capybara in Ruby, and provides three drivers for chrome, firefox and the python zopetestbrowser. The blog post demonstrates using it with Lettuce which is a Python &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BDD&lt;/span&gt; framework similar to Cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 21 &amp;#8211; 14th May 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few days late but a bit of a bumper issue. We&amp;#8217;ve also passed the 1000th subscriber so welcome to everyone who has joined recently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays Boston have released all the videos from the talks given so if you could&amp;#8217;nt make it along you can catch up on topics ranging from culture to devops in government and much talk of deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-boston/program/&quot;&gt;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-boston/program/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people have started producing Chef recipes and Puppet manifests for installing the full Cloudfoundry vcap stack. I&amp;#8217;m much more interested in Vcap that I am another hosted platform and the easier it is to get up and running the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/auser/cloudfoundry-quickstart&quot;&gt;https://github.com/auser/cloudfoundry-quickstart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any distributed system you need a mechanism for the various components to transfer and exchange date efficiently. Both Protocol Buffers (from Google) and Thrift (originally developed at Facebook and now under the Apache banner) are solutions to this problem worth knowing about, and this article does a good job of comparing the technical details of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://floatingsun.net/articles/thrift-vs-protocol-buffers/&quot;&gt;http://floatingsun.net/articles/thrift-vs-protocol-buffers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing Javascript automatically has often been problematic. The folk at Zendesk have written up how they approach the problem using Jenkins, Jasmine, PhantomJS and JSHint. The post includes some useful rake tasks that you can use to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zendesk.com/blog/javascript-loves-ci&quot;&gt;http://www.zendesk.com/blog/javascript-loves-ci&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Debois unfortunately missed giving his presentation at goto this last week, but has kindly made the slides available anyway. Damn Abstraction : Development vs Operational Efficiency goes over the the many abstractions we introduce to software projects and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/damn-abstraction-development-vs-operational-efficiency&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/damn-abstraction-development-vs-operational-efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous deployment doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be hard argues John Wedgwood, with a good post about getting started with a minimum amount of fuss and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnwedgwood.com/continuous-deployment&quot;&gt;http://www.johnwedgwood.com/continuous-deployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a counter point to the above article Jim Bird argues that not only is continuous deployment hard in many environments, it&amp;#8217;s also not always a good idea. I liked this in particular because it doesn&amp;#8217;t focus on the technical problems as much as the process, security and external relations side of deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/05/continuous-deployment-is-no-holy-grail.html&quot;&gt;http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/05/continuous-deployment-is-no-holy-grail.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Crowley wrote a great article I missed at the start of the year. Arguing good packaging is a thing of beauty and releasing a nifty tool (Debra) which looks a very simple way of approaching the Debian packaging problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rcrowley.org/articles/packaging.html&quot;&gt;http://rcrowley.org/articles/packaging.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppet has been around for a good while now and it&amp;#8217;s nice to see more and more people writing up good advice. The main thing I took away from this particular article was that learning the whole puppet language, and how to extend it, is a good way of really getting the most out of the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nuknad.com/2011/05/10/puppet-lessons-learned/&quot;&gt;http://nuknad.com/2011/05/10/puppet-lessons-learned/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test::Right is described as an opinionated Selenium testing framework. It&amp;#8217;s from the folks at Sauce Labs who know a few things about functional testing and aims to lay lots of useful groundwork for writing this sort of test, avoiding many of the common maintenance and tight coupling pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/saucelabs/test_right&quot;&gt;https://github.com/saucelabs/test_right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People occasionally comment on the large dependency chain that the Chef server has, and Fatty, from the the Opscode folk, looks to be their answer to this. It appears to be a generic tool that allows for creating a single installable&lt;br /&gt;
shell-script that can be executed on the client side. Interesting for some usecases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adamhjk/fatty&quot;&gt;https://github.com/adamhjk/fatty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating large databases is hard work, but the folks at Sound Cloud have started releasing some of the tools they&amp;#8217;ve been having success with, entertainingly nicknamed the Large Hadron Migrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2011/05/introducing-the-large-hadron-migrator-3/&quot;&gt;http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2011/05/introducing-the-large-hadron-migrator-3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondering what in the network stack is taking up the time for a given &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; request? Ruok looks a pretty handy little tool for making multiple requests and displaying the time taken for things like &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; lookup, waiting for a connection or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 20 &amp;#8211; 5th May 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to a more health mix of releases, interesting articles, tutorials and tools this week after the deluge of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; and cloud related experience reports last time. Anyone writing any interesting tools do let me know. If only I had time to try everything out personally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos from the previous London Devops event are now available. Big thanks to Adam, Ryan and Squirrel at YouDevise for letting us use their offices and for producing the videos. And thanks to Spike Morelli and James Hogarth for the two talks on Monitoring aided development and on Spacewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/22652468&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/22652468&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really excellent article from Adam Wiggins of Heroku about growing development teams. It&amp;#8217;s often missed amongst all the technology that scaling is also about scaling people, most organisations as requests, code bases and servers grow so does the team of people responsible for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/4/28/scaling_a_development_team/&quot;&gt;http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/4/28/scaling_a_development_team/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big Chef release landing this week. With 0.10.0 you get much better console behaviour, the new environments concept, easier ways of ignoring files when distributing them to nodes and encrypted data bags amongst other changes and fixes. If you&amp;#8217;re running your own Chef server you&amp;#8217;ll need to rebuild your search index though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/05/02/chef-0-10-0-released/&quot;&gt;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/05/02/chef-0-10-0-released/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at Puppet Labs are conducting a survey around devops practices. If you have a few minutes to answer a few questions I&amp;#8217;m sure the results will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://svy.mk/jNImMz&quot;&gt;http://svy.mk/jNImMz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long discussed Puppet move to use the Apache 2.0 licence instead of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt; has now happened. For most this probably makes no difference at all, although we might be some more interesting products integrated with puppet in the future because of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/relicensing-puppet-to-apache-2-0/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/relicensing-puppet-to-apache-2-0/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; programmers often get quite a big of stick but it&amp;#8217;s still a language which sees lots of use, so it&amp;#8217;s good to see comprehensive articles aimed at getting &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; folk up and running with continuous integration. Some pretty nice tools used here for static analysis to code smells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://erichogue.ca/2011/05/03/continuous-integration-in-php/&quot;&gt;http://erichogue.ca/2011/05/03/continuous-integration-in-php/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just found this article, from Mark Mayo and written in 2008, about the impending change in both the hosting environment and the role of the sysadmin. Describing the need for sysadmins to move more towards development, virtualisation and web native protocols. All still very relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vmunix.com/mark/blog/archives/2008/10/17/cloud-computing-is-a-sea-change-how-sysadmins-can-prepare/&quot;&gt;http://www.vmunix.com/mark/blog/archives/2008/10/17/cloud-computing-is-a-sea-change-how-sysadmins-can-prepare/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post from Damon Edwards about the risk of seeing devops as winning the fight for adoption. Depending on who you talk to either everyone is already doing all these things we&amp;#8217;re talking about or no-one has even heard of any of them. Timely reminder that evangelism is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon have written a pretty comprehensive outline of what went wrong, what they are doing to make it less likely in the future and offering affected customers some free service. They acknowledged communications issues during the outage and talk about how they&amp;#8217;ll improve that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick roundup of popular of unix based orchestration tools. Anyone automating a few boxes would probably benefit from having one of these in their toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rump looks an interesting addition for anyone using puppet. It brings with it a git based workflow and command line tool for easily running the client and pushing out changes to remote clients. Presentation from the recent puppetcamp and code available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether it&amp;#8217;s just because I&amp;#8217;m on holiday and have more time on my hands or whether it&amp;#8217;s just been a busy week but lots of news and interesting tool releases this last week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was busy sending the last issue Amazon &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; was having some rather epic issues. While everyones boxes where inaccessible people used the time to write blog posts about the downtime. The High Scalability blog has about 50 articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilesysadmin.net/ec2-outage-lessons&quot;&gt;http://agilesysadmin.net/ec2-outage-lessons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twilio use EC2 extensively but had very few issues, due to focusing on the principal of a &amp;#8220;unit-of-failure is a single host&amp;#8221;. This had meant they had avoided using &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; to avoid such a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan Sissel gave a talk about fpm at the recent BayLISA event. It&amp;#8217;s a great slide desk, laying down the problems with various forays in packaging and then showing code examples of using fpm to build debs and rpms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfMTdmczY2azlkcg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;pli=1&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfMTdmczY2azlkcg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;pli=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice write up by Mujtaba Hussain of mixing developers and operations staff members up a little, by loaning team members to different divisions to try and get better communication. Some good discussion in the comments too about what&amp;#8217;s worked for other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.realestate.com.au/2011/04/devops-and-associated-thoughts/&quot;&gt;http://techblog.realestate.com.au/2011/04/devops-and-associated-thoughts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common patterns for software build and release sounds like a great idea, and Julian Simpson wrote an article for the Spring 2011 issue of Methods &amp;amp; Tools on just that, based on conversations at last years &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SPA&lt;/span&gt; Conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=116&quot;&gt;http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obligatory Vagrant article this time again with a thorough write up of the benefits and purpose of Vagrant, as well as a big Drupal example. This is probably the first time I&amp;#8217;ve seen a shared Vagrantfile, which is a great idea come to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite looks pretty interesting for adhoc graphing duties, but the installation and setup isn&amp;#8217;t trivial. This article walks through all the steps and looks like it&amp;#8217;s going to turn into a series about using Graphite. Look forward the the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2011/04/installing-and-configuring-graphite.html&quot;&gt;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2011/04/installing-and-configuring-graphite.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Machine Test Harness is an interesting take on writing tests for configuration management tools. Uses &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;KVM&lt;/span&gt; under the hood to take snapshots at different states for testing against. Lacking documentation at the moment though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gregretkowski/vmth&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gregretkowski/vmth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at Rackspace have released a preview of their open source deployment tool, Cast. It&amp;#8217;s an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; driven Node.js application which aims to let you automate deployment of applications and services, although it feels odd that the example given is for Redis rather than say a web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cast-project.org/faq/&quot;&gt;http://cast-project.org/faq/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulp is a Python application for managing software repositories and their associated content, such as packages, errata, and distributions. Another tool in this area from RedHat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 18 &amp;#8211; 21st April 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another busy week, with lots of interesting tools, announcements and goings on. As I write this issue Amazon EC2 is having some nasty downtime issues. Hopefully next week I can feature some good advice on how to run things across multiple zones more easily and mitigate such problems. Anyone still staring at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; status dashboard rather than sleeping has my thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMWare announced what they&amp;#8217;ve been working on of late, and it&amp;#8217;s an open source platform as a service. It currently runs Java, Ruby and Node.js applications with hopefully more on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudfoundry.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.cloudfoundry.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in playing with OpenStack, like anything else it&amp;#8217;s useful to be able to do so locally. This article covers settings up the whole OpenStack platform under Virtualbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://uksysadmin.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/running-openstack-under-virtualbox-a-complete-guide/&quot;&gt;http://uksysadmin.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/running-openstack-under-virtualbox-a-complete-guide/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent London CI meetups have been excellent. I was out of town for the last one but luckily the video of Chris Read talking about evolving Continuous Delivery is already up online. Worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/a-sneak-preview-of-evolving-continuous-delivery/js-1600&quot;&gt;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/a-sneak-preview-of-evolving-continuous-delivery/js-1600&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of companies are both taking the build process more seriously and also often looking to take that responsibility and place it in the hands of one person. Kief Morris writes up why this is a bad idea, and why distributing this across a development team is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://grokandroll.com/Build_Monkey_Antipattern.html&quot;&gt;http://grokandroll.com/Build_Monkey_Antipattern.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well put together tutorial with clear code examples and good screen shots. It covers installing software (in this case Drizzle) onto EC2 using Chef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://posulliv.github.com/2011/04/07/drizzle-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://posulliv.github.com/2011/04/07/drizzle-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a development environment on demand using Vagrant is one I&amp;#8217;m pretty keen on. This article again introduces the tool as well as pointing out a couple of issues the author ran into in getting things up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biven.org/writing/dev_on_demand_with_vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://biven.org/writing/dev_on_demand_with_vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in the position to be looking at different configuration management tools this product matrix might be useful. It covers a wide range of tools in some detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/software/sysconfigtools/overview&quot;&gt;http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/software/sysconfigtools/overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Vincent is looking for some feedback on what the Operational primitives are in peoples workflows, specifically related to the tool Noah that&amp;#8217;s in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/04/operational-primitives.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/04/operational-primitives.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good reminder that using trending data collected in tools like Ganglia or Collectd is perfect for powering alerting in tools such as Nagios. If you&amp;#8217;re not already going this it&amp;#8217;s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vuksan.com/blog/2011/04/19/use-your-trending-data-for-alerting/&quot;&gt;http://vuksan.com/blog/2011/04/19/use-your-trending-data-for-alerting/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week to go until the deadline for paper proposals for a special issue of Cutters to be edited by Patrick Debois. This looks particularly interesting as the list of topics is all about culture, not technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cutter.com/content-and-analysis/journals-and-reports/cutter-it-journal/callforpapers03.html&quot;&gt;http://www.cutter.com/content-and-analysis/journals-and-reports/cutter-it-journal/callforpapers03.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly some projects are encouraging folks to install software by running a remote shell script. This might be evil in many ways but folks are using it so I&amp;#8217;m glad a project like Gosh exists. Gosh gives you a bit of an insight into the code you&amp;#8217;re about to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/gosh&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sstephenson/gosh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a one man war against the failings of ruby packaging Jordan Sissel has been working on a simple way of creating system packages from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RVM&lt;/span&gt; builds. Very promising.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 17 &amp;#8211; 11th April 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry for the delay in getting this issue out, but I hope stuffing it with even more good content will compensate a little. I spent the end of last week in Edinburgh for the Scottish Ruby Conference and, as well as watching some pretty good talks, met a few subscribers and talked an awful lot about Chef, Puppet and Vagrant. Good to meet everyone I bumped into.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always found Varnish documentation by jumping between mailing lists and various bits of the internet, for most things I&amp;#8217;ll now probably go to this epic blog post. It doesn&amp;#8217;t just cover the obvious caching of static files, but demonstrates more advantages tricks with dynamic content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devblog.factual.com/practical-guide-to-varnish&quot;&gt;http://devblog.factual.com/practical-guide-to-varnish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Allspaw&amp;#8217;s latest post is a pretty thought provoking read, attempting to introduce Resilience Engineering and position it at the heart of how business prioritises activities. It&amp;#8217;s part I as well so presumably more on the subject on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/04/07/resilience-engineering-part-i/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/04/07/resilience-engineering-part-i/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rackspace have rolled out a load balancer feature for their cloud stack. This article covers the details of setting it up for use with other Rackspace cloud instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudservers.rackspacecloud.com/index.php/Configuring_a_Cloud_Load_Balancer&quot;&gt;http://cloudservers.rackspacecloud.com/index.php/Configuring_a_Cloud_Load_Balancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s just useful to have a big old list of bullet points to remind you about a broad topic. This post from Ricky Ho could be useful if you don&amp;#8217;t know where to start, although it would be nice to see lots more references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://architects.dzone.com/news/scalable-system-design-0&quot;&gt;http://architects.dzone.com/news/scalable-system-design-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replay Solutions carried out a survey of companies, focusing on management and larger organisations around devops. This might be useful to those fighting the good fight and needing to convince the powers that be. The survey results are available as a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; from that page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://replaysolutions.com/company/news/59&quot;&gt;http://replaysolutions.com/company/news/59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finding more and more long, well thought out posts that I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll be referring back to again and again. This post from Stephanie Dean covers processes and practices to use and put in place when everything around you is going wrong. It ends with a great list of responsibilities for the different groups involved that everyone should read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stephaniekdean.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/eventmgmt/&quot;&gt;http://stephaniekdean.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/eventmgmt/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altering based on a percentage is pretty common, and is the default in many popular monitoring applications. It&amp;#8217;s also counter productive and sometimes dangerous according to Chris Siebenmann. He argues very well that the defaults exist because it&amp;#8217;s easy to do, and as someone who has been warning about a machine with 20GB of disk left in the past because of this I&amp;#8217;m coming round to the same viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/NoAlertOnPercentages&quot;&gt;http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/NoAlertOnPercentages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more folks are writing up their continuous deployment setups, which I think is a great think. The more shared experience the more we can get to a stage where common tools for things like this exist, lowering the costs and barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prettyprint.me/2011/01/24/continuous-deployment-at-outbrain/&quot;&gt;http://prettyprint.me/2011/01/24/continuous-deployment-at-outbrain/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a fan of using monit, daemon, logrotate and cron for running daemonised services then it&amp;#8217;s probably not because of the setup and configuration. pmonit caught my eye as a painless looking approach to getting these all working together quickly. Although I&amp;#8217;d be tempted to pull some of this out into Chef recipes or Puppet manifests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emgee/pmonit&quot;&gt;https://github.com/emgee/pmonit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent blog post and application code from Posterous. They ran into issues around optimising caching, and build some pretty impressive tools to allow log play back and generate statistics on cache behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technology.posterous.com/planning-and-engineering-your-cache-for-maxim-0&quot;&gt;http://technology.posterous.com/planning-and-engineering-your-cache-for-maxim-0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vincentchu/sim_cache&quot;&gt;https://github.com/vincentchu/sim_cache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who end up talking about low level monitoring of Java applications always sound angry. This tool acts as a connector between &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JMX&lt;/span&gt; and a number of different monitoring systems including cacti, rrdtool, graphite and plain old stdout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 16 &amp;#8211; 31st March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll start this issue with a bit of a call to action. It turns out that the Devops Wikipedia page needs some love. It&amp;#8217;s led to a few confused views this last week or so and as more and more people come across the term it&amp;#8217;s something folks will turn to. It would be great if the community chipped in on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps. Onwards to the real content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always love posts where people describe, ideally with diagrams, how a system architecture works. Digg posted this interesting blog post this week doing just that. It goes into a little detail about the services they use and the technology stack they employ. More posts are promised as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://about.digg.com/blog/how-digg-is-built&quot;&gt;http://about.digg.com/blog/how-digg-is-built&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Debois has been pushing Vagrant in a small team setup and a complex application with great results. The post is a great walkthrough of the how and why, this some good observations about using a tool like vagrant in a team setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2011/03/28/using-vagrant-as-a-team/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2011/03/28/using-vagrant-as-a-team/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been showing various people Chef recently and one problem a few people have commented on is the discoverability of some of the documentation. Sean OMeara pointed out that the docs are vast and broken up into many pages on the Opscode wiki and wrote up a great index along with a brief explanation of each of the main topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/3889872012/a-can-of-condensed-chef-documentation&quot;&gt;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/3889872012/a-can-of-condensed-chef-documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing driving lots of the talk around devops is the move towards software as a service, whether that means inside a large company or paying a third party for an internet based setup. This post has some nice observations about the changes needed if you&amp;#8217;re more familiar with the more traditional software delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omniti.com/seeds/from-making-software-to-running-saas&quot;&gt;http://omniti.com/seeds/from-making-software-to-running-saas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.I.Pienaar continues his self appointed task of making monitoring better. I&amp;#8217;m liking the sound of a framework that can build monitoring systems, meaning you&amp;#8217;ll have to add code to the mix to get something useful but that should be specific to your needs, and able to evolve with you over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/25/monitoring_framework_event_correlation.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/25/monitoring_framework_event_correlation.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup of DevOps &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ATL&lt;/span&gt; in Atlanta. Some good points about how particular pain points and skunkworks projects, especially in larger more formal organisations, can help embed newer practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/the-state-of-devops-down-south-tips-on-deploying-devops-practices/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/the-state-of-devops-down-south-tips-on-deploying-devops-practices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always like being reminded why something is important. These slides on continuous integration are a good read, or maybe something to sent to your boss or colleagues who are interested in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter released the Murder deployment tool using BitTorrent a while ago. Russ Garrett has just released a Python variant of the idea, but with fewer opinions about how you&amp;#8217;ll use it. As Russ put it &amp;#8220;It was designed for pushing code out to a number of production systems. You can probably use it for other things.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 15 &amp;#8211; 24th March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This issue contains the word metrics repeatedly and it seems more and more we&amp;#8217;re focused on gathering data to make the case for what we&amp;#8217;re trying to do. That might be code or infrastructure changes or wholesale business improvement, but all things considered this analytical approach feels like a good thing to me. But then my background was as an experimental Physicist so I&amp;#8217;m probably biased.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of devops is organisational change, and metrics provide a good discussion point to try and prove why change is needed. But metrics can be used for the opposite reason, eloquently described here as using metrics as a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/JustifyingChanges&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/JustifyingChanges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of writing tests for configuration management has been around for a while but this take on it looks particularly interesting. Using cucumber to make assertions based on puppet providers looks a pretty simple approach code wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/puppet/puppet-cucumber-providers.html&quot;&gt;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/puppet/puppet-cucumber-providers.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOpsDays Boston 2011 sounded like it was a great event and this writeup of one of the openspace events sounds interesting. 20 people spoke about using metrics for tracking the effects of changes in your Dev / Ops environments and jotted down a pretty good list of interesting things to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroturnaround.com/blog/how-to-measure-the-effectiveness-of-implementing-devops/&quot;&gt;http://www.zeroturnaround.com/blog/how-to-measure-the-effectiveness-of-implementing-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More good Vagrant tutorials, this time with a really good end to end &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; example going from the why to a full set of Puppet manifests for bootstrapping a symphony development environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moving Fast at Scale microconference at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt; looked like one of the highlights of the week and the increasingly nice folks at Etsy have released all the slides from the event. These covered Scaling Startups, Continuous Deployment, Etsy&amp;#8217;s inhouse deployment tool Deployinator and talk of Metrics-driven Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/03/19/moving-fast-at-scale-slides-and-reprise/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/03/19/moving-fast-at-scale-slides-and-reprise/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However much you love Nagios (or your monitoring tool of choice) it likely feels somewhat dated when it comes to dealing with a modern dynamic infrastructure where new machines come and go regularly and often automatically. R.I.Pienaar has been prototyping a new monitoring system that aims to solve that problem as well as potentially many others. One to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/19/thinking_about_monitoring_frameworks.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/19/thinking_about_monitoring_frameworks.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of Devops is definitely self improvement, and this article about steps to improve as a sysadmin is interesting, the focus on tasks that might historically simply been shunted to developers in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cwebber.ucr.edu/2011/03/the-journey-to-senior-sysadmin/&quot;&gt;http://cwebber.ucr.edu/2011/03/the-journey-to-senior-sysadmin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stackops is a distro based on Ubuntu 10.04 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LTS&lt;/span&gt; Server that allows for installing the various components of the OpenStack Nova platform via a simple to use installer. If Openstack is the ‘Linux’ of the cloud operating systems, StackOps wants to be the reference distribution of this operating system which seems a nobel and lofty goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackops.com/2011/03/23/stackops-distro-smart-installer-deploy-openstack-in-your-datacenter/&quot;&gt;http://blog.stackops.com/2011/03/23/stackops-distro-smart-installer-deploy-openstack-in-your-datacenter/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re deploying applications to Heroku, then Heroku-Bartender might be of interest. It&amp;#8217;s a very simple continuous deployment tool which shows you all the commits to a given Git branch and allows you to trigger a deployment of one via a web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 14 &amp;#8211; 17th March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More interesting news and tools from last week. If anyone has anything they think would be of interest to folks do let me know at gareth@morethanseven.net&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to get a site built this week to provide a list of Vagrant base boxes. The question comes up on Twitter or blog posts or mailing lists pretty regularly. Hopefully a few people find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vagrantbox.es/&quot;&gt;http://www.vagrantbox.es/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon have just expanded their virtual networking for Amazon EC2, adding in lots more functionality which to my mind make it much more useful. You can now run with a single public subnet, with public and private subnets, with Internet and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; access or with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; access only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/03/new-approach-amazon-ec2-networking.html&quot;&gt;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/03/new-approach-amazon-ec2-networking.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean Wilson has been doing some interesting things around testing deployments and infrastructure changes using Nagios, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NRPE&lt;/span&gt; Runner looks a handy tool if you&amp;#8217;re interested in doing the same. The basic premise is to have a command allowing you to run your nagios checks like a test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/commandline/introducing-nrpe-runner.html&quot;&gt;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/commandline/introducing-nrpe-runner.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Dziuba&amp;#8217;s latest article covers what and why to monitor, and what makes for a good system that can be easily checked. The focus of monitoring checks should be to keep them Informative and Actionable, which I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teddziuba.com/2011/03/monitoring-theory.html&quot;&gt;http://teddziuba.com/2011/03/monitoring-theory.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zed Shaw always writes good opinion pieces and this one has a number of good points. The basic gist is that more programmers should actually learn how statistics really works, which I have to agree with. The more we look for evidence for application or process improvements the more important it is to get the analysis right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html&quot;&gt;http://zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pretty formal article introducing some folks to the concepts behind Devops. I&amp;#8217;m quite interested in the idea that Devops might be a sort-of bridge between IT Service management with Agile development practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmcrossroads.com/behaviorally-speaking/13925-behaviorally-speaking-devops-101&quot;&gt;http://www.cmcrossroads.com/behaviorally-speaking/13925-behaviorally-speaking-devops-101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branches are an important part of lots of development workflows, and with the increasing adoption of version control for configuration management file and the mantra of &amp;#8220;infrastructure as code&amp;#8221; some people are starting to talk about how to use branches for these too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.carlossanchez.eu/2011/03/15/new-challenges-from-devops-development-cycle-for-your-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;http://blog.carlossanchez.eu/2011/03/15/new-challenges-from-devops-development-cycle-for-your-infrastructure/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice folks at Etsy continue releasing various useful tools, this time Logster is a very handy looking tool for parsing log files and generating metrics for Graphite and Ganglia from the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maciej Ceglowski has written up the full story of the days and nights when the internet descended on Pinboard after Yahoo attempted to kill off Delicious. All sorts of good recommendations and observations about running a site under load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pinboard.in/blog/173/&quot;&gt;http://pinboard.in/blog/173/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being both a big fan of testing and of monitoring I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking for a while about all the parallels between the two. This blog post by Grig Gheorghiu covers just that, expanding on a number of similarities. I&amp;#8217;d have liked to see mention of overlapping tools or the lack thereof as I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to write something on that myself for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2011/03/monitoring-is-for-ops-what-testing-is.html&quot;&gt;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2011/03/monitoring-is-for-ops-what-testing-is.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts have been writing interesting things about the whole devops idea and I thought this set of observations from a large &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; event were interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.forrester.com/dave_west/11-03-09-dev_ops_fell_on_deaf_ears_at_ibm_pulse_2011&quot;&gt;http://blogs.forrester.com/dave_west/11-03-09-dev_ops_fell_on_deaf_ears_at_ibm_pulse_2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting article from Erwin Bolwidt about what he terms Stateless Computing. This goes into more details, along with a clear outline of the advantages and some practical tips, on using an image based deployment approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.worldturner.com/worldturner/entry/stateless_computing&quot;&gt;http://blog.worldturner.com/worldturner/entry/stateless_computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Robins from Opscode gave what sounded like a great talk at DevopsDays Boston called Devops Culture Hacks. Martin J. Logan was on hand to live blog it in detail, covering various ways you can help create real change in organisations that already have a way of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 19th of May in London &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UKUUG&lt;/span&gt; are running a full day workshop on Debian packaging run by Phil Hands. This sounds like a great way of getting starting with system packaging if you&amp;#8217;re wondering where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ukuug.org/events/debian2011/&quot;&gt;http://www.ukuug.org/events/debian2011/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mytop has been around for a long time, but it&amp;#8217;s nice to see an introductory article showing how to use it for those that might not have come across it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.junauza.com/2011/02/live-performance-monitor-for-your-mysql.html&quot;&gt;http://www.junauza.com/2011/02/live-performance-monitor-for-your-mysql.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabric now has a 1.0 release, including improvements to the main workhorses of sudo, run, put and get. Also puts in place some of the groundwork for writing tests for fabfiles and task namespacing in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://readthedocs.org/docs/fabric/en/1.0.0/changes/1.0.html&quot;&gt;http://readthedocs.org/docs/fabric/en/1.0.0/changes/1.0.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knife is the command line tool used for managing Chef nodes and it&amp;#8217;s now been much improved for those using Windows environments. Knife-windows adds commands to bootstrap and run commands on remote windows machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opscode/knife-windows&quot;&gt;https://github.com/opscode/knife-windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve not spent enough time looking at looks like ZooKeeper to see where they fit in, but this article takes on that subject and also introduces an alternative tool, Noah, which looks particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/03/ad-hoc-configuration-coordination-and.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/03/ad-hoc-configuration-coordination-and.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 12 &amp;#8211; 1st March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A big thank you to everyone who filled out the survey last week. So far I&amp;#8217;ve amassed over 600 responses which should make for some good analysis. Now with interesting devops new for the week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big news this week was Amazon&amp;#8217;s launch of CloudFormation, which is a way of creating templates to describe your infrastructure, which can then be executed to provision EC2 instances and other &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; components automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&quot;&gt;http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On hearing about CloudFormation various parts of the internet exploded with comments about how they no longer needed Chef or Puppet, missing the difference between configuration management and provisioning (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; specific provisioning at that) entirely. Luckily Mitchell Hashimoto (of Vagrant fame) and Stephen Nelson-Smith both came to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilesysadmin.net/cloudformation&quot;&gt;http://agilesysadmin.net/cloudformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitchellhashimoto.com/post/3526628232/cloudformation-the-big-picture&quot;&gt;http://mitchellhashimoto.com/post/3526628232/cloudformation-the-big-picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.I.Pienaar meanwhile was busy showing how CloudFormation can be useful (with a great mcollective example) and then breaking down some of the good and bad points about the current implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/02/26/mcollective_101_demo_using_aws_cloudformation.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/02/26/mcollective_101_demo_using_aws_cloudformation.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js got some nice things said about it by the smart folk at SimpleGeo. They argue that Node.js is a good candidate for production services right now and outline some of the reasons they chose it and things they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/2/22/is-nodejs-becoming-a-part-of-the-stack-simplegeo-says-yes.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/2/22/is-nodejs-becoming-a-part-of-the-stack-simplegeo-says-yes.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in Chicago this Saturday you might be interested in a Puppet Hack-a-thon being organised by Martin J. Logan. Two tracks and Puppetlabs founder Teyo Tyree should make for an interesting event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/devops/events/16513536/&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/devops/events/16513536/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tav has reworked the core of Fabric to add all sorts of shiny new features and remove a few scars. An environment variable manager, remote script execution, contexts (more advanced roles and hosts control), parallel deployment, stages, a build-in shell, autocompletion and even colours for output. And some other things too. I really hope this gets merged upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tav.espians.com/fabric-python-with-cleaner-api-and-parallel-deployment-support.html&quot;&gt;http://tav.espians.com/fabric-python-with-cleaner-api-and-parallel-deployment-support.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting presentation, that actually works just reading the slides. Interesting alternative to package installation and bootstrapping using Fabric and an extension called Cuisine. And details of system monitoring using Watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/ffunction/fabric-cuisine-and-watchdog-for-server-administration-in-python&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/ffunction/fabric-cuisine-and-watchdog-for-server-administration-in-python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 11 &amp;#8211; 22th February 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last week was pretty light on tools so I&amp;#8217;ve this week I&amp;#8217;ve found all sorts of interesting looking new toys to play with. I&amp;#8217;d love to see and stories of success or failure if anyone tries any of these out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m constantly interested in how everyone does deployment subtly or wildly differently so I&amp;#8217;ve decided to run a survey rather than just base my thoughts on my own personal experience and here say. If you have 5 minutes and have anything to do with deploying web sites or applications then please fill in the following Google form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/webdeployment&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/webdeployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases you don&amp;#8217;t want or can&amp;#8217;t have lots of automated small releases as you push code but you do want everything that comes with the workflow around continuous deployment. A good article about terminology, around why the recent book was called continuous delivery and why deployment should maybe have been release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/&quot;&gt;http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just want to be in the bay area and this event on Data Collection and Logging looks great. You&amp;#8217;ve probably seen talks about processing data with Hadoop, but how did that data get collected in the first place? Are you using Scribe, Chukwa, or something else? And where are you keeping all that data until you&amp;#8217;re ready to process it?  What about after you process it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Area-Large-Scale-Production-Engineering/events/15481136/&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Area-Large-Scale-Production-Engineering/events/15481136/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pretty interesting argument that devops is a way of insourcing work back into development teams that&amp;#8217;s previously been outsourced. Drawing parallels to how agile made testing sexy and got people interested in tooling. Worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2011/02/16/the-developer-landgrab-another-way-to-look-at-devops/&quot;&gt;http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2011/02/16/the-developer-landgrab-another-way-to-look-at-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always nice to see more people talking about vagrant, very quick example but it does contain a link to a Centos base box for the latest version of Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maestrodev.com/blogs/vagrant-is-my-new-best-friend&quot;&gt;http://www.maestrodev.com/blogs/vagrant-is-my-new-best-friend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice list of 8 things to think about when deploying mysql databases, with a specific focus on EC2 environments. Not loads of detail but a nice list to have handy if you&amp;#8217;re not already a database expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iheavy.com/2011/02/21/deploying-mysql-on-amazon-ec2-best-practices/&quot;&gt;http://www.iheavy.com/2011/02/21/deploying-mysql-on-amazon-ec2-best-practices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting looking continuous deployment framework that makes use of ZooKeeper. At it&amp;#8217;s heart a daemon you install on your production machines and a command to trigger those nodes to pull your latest application from your continuous integration system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mconigliaro/conveyor&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mconigliaro/conveyor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment tools are definitely interesting lots of people at the moment and Meerkatalyst looks like an interesting continuous deployment server allowing developers to deploy &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.net or Ruby projects. Currently invite only but you can sign up on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meerkatalyst.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.meerkatalyst.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poni describes itself as a systems management tool for defining, deploying and verifying complex multi-node computer systems. It looks like a pretty comprehensive command line tool with cloud provisioning baked in as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://melor.github.com/poni/index.html&quot;&gt;http://melor.github.com/poni/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally yet another deployment tool, this time called Beehive which is written in Erlang and Ruby. Again lots of good examples and documentation for getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getbeehive.com/&quot;&gt;http://getbeehive.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/02/15/issue-10</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 10 &amp;#8211; 15th February 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And we&amp;#8217;re already onto the 10th edition. To celebrate I&amp;#8217;ve gone and paid for an upgrade to my Mailchimp account, meaning that all the links you see should now not be horrible link tracking things. Lots of people complained about that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m organising another talks evening in London on the 3rd of March, kindly hosted by the nice folks at youDevise again. We&amp;#8217;ll have three talks; one on Spacewalk, one on monitoring and another to be announced. Only a few tickets left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://londondevops.eventwax.com/devops-talks&quot;&gt;https://londondevops.eventwax.com/devops-talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another London event, this time of the paid variety from Thoughtworks. Jez Humble and Chris Turner, are running a full day workshop on March 10th on continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.regonline.com/builder/site/Default.aspx?EventID=936039&quot;&gt;https://www.regonline.com/builder/site/Default.aspx?EventID=936039&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of a couple of Puppet articles I read with interest this week. This one covers self-classifying puppet nodes, and is a good walkthrough with code examples of using puppet and mcollective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nuknad.com/2011/02/11/self-classifying-puppet-nodes/&quot;&gt;http://nuknad.com/2011/02/11/self-classifying-puppet-nodes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second puppet article, about the best way of separating whether you want something installed and whether you want it running in a puppet module. Some good alternatives and discussion in the comments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/ensure-running&quot;&gt;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/ensure-running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of devops talk is still focused on the technology and I&amp;#8217;m probably as guilty of featuring more technology material than anything else. This article caught my eye this week though on what devops really means to business minded folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evolven.com/blog/devops-misunderstandings-and-how-devops-really-drives-business-needs.html&quot;&gt;http://www.evolven.com/blog/devops-misunderstandings-and-how-devops-really-drives-business-needs.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrations are always hairy and this post has some nice details about how Involver moved from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; recently. Just enough juicy details to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://invalidlogic.com/2011/02/11/how-we-did-a-datacenter-migration-with-no-downtime/&quot;&gt;http://invalidlogic.com/2011/02/11/how-we-did-a-datacenter-migration-with-no-downtime/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought provoking video from Randy Shoup talking at QCon about how programming might evolve as more and more things take advantage of cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Evolving-Programming-for-the-Cloud&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Evolving-Programming-for-the-Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the slides from the presentations at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt; are showing up online. I particularly liked Joshua&amp;#8217;s Chef 101 and application deployment double presentation. A good introduction in the first half and a detailed look at deploying apps using Chef in the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jtimberman/fosdem-chef101appdeploy&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jtimberman/fosdem-chef101appdeploy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatula looks an interesting tool for anyone using Chef. It provides a simple command line interface to the Opscode cookbooks stored in the official repository, allowing you to search, get details of and download quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 9 - 8th February 2011</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 9 &amp;#8211; 8th February 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the ninth instalment of Devops Weekly. A little later than intended as I&amp;#8217;ve been in Brussels for the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt; conference. But we&amp;#8217;re back to being out on Tuesday again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DevOps Survey 2010 results are in. Over 200 people filled in the survey and the results have been collated and graphed. Worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekle.id.au/2011/01/devops-survey-2010-results.html&quot;&gt;http://www.geekle.id.au/2011/01/devops-survey-2010-results.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgium is definitely on a roll when it comes to useful technical events and Load looks to be no exception. It&amp;#8217;s in Wilrijk on April 16th-17th and is geared towards Linux sysadmins and people interested in linux administration. A call for papers is up now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loadays.org/news/call-presentations&quot;&gt;http://www.loadays.org/news/call-presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More proof that at least the analysts are listening to people about devops. I&amp;#8217;m not convinced that platform as a service is really the answer to everything but the comments in particular are worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/11-02-07-i_dont_want_devops_i_want_noops&quot;&gt;http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/11-02-07-i_dont_want_devops_i_want_noops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brightbox, the UK based web host, have launched a load balancer component to their cloud hosting platform. Unlike Amazon &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; you can point an IP address at a load balancer, meaning you don&amp;#8217;t have to use &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; records, which might be useful to some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.brightbox.co.uk/posts/cloud-load-balancers-beta&quot;&gt;http://blog.brightbox.co.uk/posts/cloud-load-balancers-beta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m hearing more and more people try to configure systems so they don&amp;#8217;t need to ever login to them. This article is a pretty good explanation of how you might come to that conclusion and what you need to think about to make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://me.andering.com/2011/02/03/server-login-considered-harmful/&quot;&gt;http://me.andering.com/2011/02/03/server-login-considered-harmful/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things still take lots of commands and the first step to automating them is to write everything down. This article covers creating a bootable virtual application using VMWare and does just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.worldturner.com/worldturner/entry/creating_a_bootable_virtual_appliance&quot;&gt;http://blog.worldturner.com/worldturner/entry/creating_a_bootable_virtual_appliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah is a lightweight node and service registry based on Zookeeper. Zookepper did always strike me as interesting but pretty impenetrable. Noah uses Redis on the backend and is written in Ruby and already looks well documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lusis/Noah&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lusis/Noah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node Control is a node.js based system admin and code deployment too for executing commands on many remote machines in parallel via ssh. I&amp;#8217;m finding it interesting that node.js is cropping up more and more as a platform for writing system tools like this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 8 &amp;#8211; 28th January 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the eighth instalment of Devops Weekly. More than 660 people have now signed up and the list is growing every week. Thanks for sticking around and do let me know what you&amp;#8217;d like to see more (or less) of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are interested in building a shared vocabulary and understanding at the moment, including this take on documenting release management. The author is seeking input from devops flavoured folk so any ideas you have should be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erp4it.com/erp4it/2011/01/release-management-integration-pattern-seeking-devops-comments.html&quot;&gt;http://www.erp4it.com/erp4it/2011/01/release-management-integration-pattern-seeking-devops-comments.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Relic have a great product for monitoring Java and Ruby applications and publish the odd bit of interesting insight into what they get up to too. They recently moved database servers and documented how they went about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.newrelic.com/2011/01/26/how-do-you-move-more-than-6000-customers-in-2-hours/&quot;&gt;http://blog.newrelic.com/2011/01/26/how-do-you-move-more-than-6000-customers-in-2-hours/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt; is only weeks away and the official site has started publishing a few interviews. Spike, who some people might have seen talk at the last devopsdays event in Hamburg, is talking again this time about monitoring and the transition from being a full time sysadmin to a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2011/interview/spike-morelli&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2011/interview/spike-morelli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMVU&lt;/span&gt;, who originally described how they went about continuous deployment, have written up how they deal with intermittently failing tests across a rather large test suite. Interesting problem and solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.imvu.com/2011/01/19/buildbot-and-intermittent-tests/&quot;&gt;http://engineering.imvu.com/2011/01/19/buildbot-and-intermittent-tests/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet Labs is hosting its bi-annual conference for users and developers in Amsterdam on April 28th and 29th. Early bird tickets are available now and the call for papers ends March 6th for those interested in speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-camp/puppet-camp-ams-2011-info&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-camp/puppet-camp-ams-2011-info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always nice to be able to experiment with a web &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; before you jump head long into code and Jazor looks a nice way of pushing and prodding &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; based services when curl isn&amp;#8217;t quite the right tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://conigliaro.org/2011/01/24/jazor-a-simple-command-line-json-parsing-tool/&quot;&gt;http://conigliaro.org/2011/01/24/jazor-a-simple-command-line-json-parsing-tool/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pallet describes itself as an agile cloud development tool for developers, sysadmins, and operations. It&amp;#8217;s a clojure based tool which doesn&amp;#8217;t use a central server or require you to install an agent on each node. The blog contains links to good presentation materials and example code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 7 &amp;#8211; 21st January 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the seventh instalment of Devops Weekly. More tools and events this week than news, so if you&amp;#8217;re looking for things to spend your time on this should hopefully be a good issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fosdem is just weeks away and a specific devops meal out is being organised again for the night before the conference. Last year was a good opportunity to put faces to names so I&amp;#8217;ll definitely be along again this year. Register as places are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsfosdem2011.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;http://devopsfosdem2011.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet Labs are running several masters 3 day courses in Boston and Brussels in the coming weeks. If you&amp;#8217;re using puppet and somewhere in the vicinity these might be useful for you or your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/events/boston-training-jan-11/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/events/boston-training-jan-11/&lt;/a&gt; Jan 31 &amp;#8211; Feb 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/events/brussels-training-feb-11/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/events/brussels-training-feb-11/&lt;/a&gt; Feb 8 &amp;#8211; Feb 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief glimpse into some of the technical details surrounding how Google do large scale experiments and testing. This blog post has picked up on a few interesting snippets of how Google go about deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://glinden.blogspot.com/2011/01/experiment-infrastructure-at-google.html&quot;&gt;http://glinden.blogspot.com/2011/01/experiment-infrastructure-at-google.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Crawley from Devstructure launched Gimme Servers this week, which is a super simple interface to launching Rackspace cloud instances. If you&amp;#8217;ve used the existing web based dashboard you&amp;#8217;ll know why this exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gimmeservers.com/&quot;&gt;http://gimmeservers.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon launched Elastic Beanstalk, which provides more of a platform as a service layer on top of EC2. At the moment that means an autoscaling tomcat instance along with build in load balancing and auto-scaling of resources based on utilisation. Very nice looking indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/01/introducing-elastic-beanstalk.html&quot;&gt;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/01/introducing-elastic-beanstalk.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shameless self promotion warning. Here&amp;#8217;s article I write last week regarding why software developers like me should care more about system packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages.html&quot;&gt;http://morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FPM&lt;/span&gt; looks awesome. If you have to deal with gems or node.js npm packages but you&amp;#8217;d rather be dealing with rpms or debs, or you have a debian package with some maintainer scripts you&amp;#8217;d rather strip out and manage using chef/puppet, then this tool is for you. It&amp;#8217;s early days it seems but I&amp;#8217;m hoping other input and output formats will be added soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagiosharder is a tool for querying the state of a nagios instance from a nice Ruby &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. This looks ideal if you&amp;#8217;re trying to show dashboards or reports without the rest of Nagios getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/railsmachine/nagiosharder&quot;&gt;https://github.com/railsmachine/nagiosharder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing with large data sets is good fun, but managing all the software required might not be your thing. In which case this set of tools from Infochimps might be useful. It&amp;#8217;s a series of chef recipes designed specifically for managing Hadoop and Cassandra clusters, including creating and mounting &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; and setting up &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NFS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 6 &amp;#8211; 14th January 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the sixth instalment of Devops Weekly. I&amp;#8217;ve had a few people contact me about putting job opportunities in the list and I&amp;#8217;m giving that a go this week. Shout up if don&amp;#8217;t like this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston is the venue for the next devopsdays conference and you have until February 20th to get your proposals in if you&amp;#8217;d like to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua Timberman from Opscode is in London next month to give a 3 day Chef Fundamentals course from 31st of January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of the tools I generally use work only on Linux or Unix environments but some people are trying to take along of these same ideas into the Windows world. Jon Topper is currently trying to organise a get together in London and asking people when they could meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great article re-imaginging stored procedures. DBA&amp;#8217;s and developers working more closely together sounds like a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jaksprats.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/datastore-side-scripting-can-prevent-bottlenecks/&quot;&gt;http://jaksprats.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/datastore-side-scripting-can-prevent-bottlenecks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a detailed high level description of all the things you could and should be monitoring look no further. Mathias Meyer has written a great article covering the different levels you probably want monitoring and why, along with reference to tools that fit that problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook talking about scaling is always good and these take aways from a talk by Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, are interesting reading. It concentrates mainly on how to scale an organisation which I think is just as important as the technology side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/6/10/the-four-meta-secrets-of-scaling-at-facebook.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/6/10/the-four-meta-secrets-of-scaling-at-facebook.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LASIC&lt;/span&gt; is a language that facilitates creating and managing systems in a cloud environment. At the moment it only supports Amazon &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; but looks like it might be interesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/lasic/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/lasic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeAgent is a fast growing and hugely popular UK based startup obsessed with building fantastic online accounting software. We&amp;#8217;re a small team of smart people looking to hire productive Ruby and Rails developers in Edinburgh or Cambridge. You&amp;#8217;ll be working on adding and maintaining features for our existing applications and making sure our software scales up as we inevitably take over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeagentcentral.com/company/jobs&quot;&gt;http://www.freeagentcentral.com/company/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bin Weevils are looking for a new &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; developer/sysadmin to join the team and continue the development of our &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; backed flash-based game. Being able to handle things at extreme scale is kinda fun &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a quiet day that does less than 5,000 concurrent users and 10+ million hits on our servers (and that&amp;#8217;s a drop in the ocean compared to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; and other servers we run). New code is written in the Zend Framework, with use of Nginx, Memcache and also some Java servers. For sysadmin tasks, an appreciation of tools like Chef and Capistrano would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 5 &amp;#8211; 7th January 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the fifth instalment of Devops Weekly. Sorry for the slow start this year, I&amp;#8217;ve been a little busy getting the new year started (so still no &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; version, sorry). Luckily the internet has been busy too so here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ve been reading these past few weeks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off a few upcoming events. If you&amp;#8217;re in Paris the second devops meetup is scheduled for the 12th of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com/2011/paris-devops-meetup-2/&quot;&gt;http://lanyrd.com/2011/paris-devops-meetup-2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago a few days later on the 15th of January a Chef Hackathon is being held. This looks like a full day event and some of the Opscode folk are going to be going along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/devops/calendar/15648262/&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/devops/calendar/15648262/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interview with Adrian Cole about Jclouds (a Java library for interacting with cloud services like EC2) has a few interesting points. In particular the build in in-memory version of S3 especially for writing tests against is a nice idea. Worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/adrian-cole-jclouds&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/adrian-cole-jclouds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next article shows a couple of approaches to having EC2 (or any cloud instance) automatically register with your puppetmaster. Good examples and good explanation of what you&amp;#8217;re doing and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codelord.net/2010/12/19/using-puppet-to-automatically-configure-new-ec2-instances/&quot;&gt;http://www.codelord.net/2010/12/19/using-puppet-to-automatically-configure-new-ec2-instances/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good lengthy walkthrough of starting out with Chef. If you&amp;#8217;ve been using Chef for a while it&amp;#8217;s easy to forget the initial barrier of getting going so I really liked the conversational style and personal experience approach to this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beacon.wharton.upenn.edu/404/2010/12/chef-out-of-the-gate/&quot;&gt;http://beacon.wharton.upenn.edu/404/2010/12/chef-out-of-the-gate/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; is probably one of the most useful and used tools in anyones toolbox and the number of tricks and features is surprisingly large. This ever growing blog post is documenting in an easy to read manner all manner of tips and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://crunchtools.com/ssh-keychain/&quot;&gt;http://crunchtools.com/ssh-keychain/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice folk at Etsy have open sourced an internal node.js tool they are using to collect and aggregate statistics. StatsD provides a very straightforward interface for collecting arbitrary stats and feeding them into Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/statsd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/etsy/statsd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m always interested in another continuos integration server and Big Tuna looks nice. It&amp;#8217;s a Rails based application, supports multiple version control systems and has a nice looking interface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 4 &amp;#8211; 21st December 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the fourth instalment of Devops Weekly. I&amp;#8217;ll probably be taking a break next week while I&amp;#8217;m on holiday, so the next issue should be available in the new year. As always email gareth@morethanseven.net if you have anything you&amp;#8217;d like included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Configuration Management DevRoom at Fosdem next year is looking for talks, anyone interested has until the 8th of January to submit. Presentations are to be formal and not longer than 30 minutes, plus 15 &lt;br /&gt;
extra for questions (45 in total). Panels with more than one speaker are also of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/call-for-papers-configuration-management-devroom-at-fosdem-2011/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/call-for-papers-configuration-management-devroom-at-fosdem-2011/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be using either Glassfish or Puppet but I found this article interesting anyway as it&amp;#8217;s a good walk though of taking unpackaged software fresh from the developers and going through the steps of packaging and automating installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.screv.com/?p=143&quot;&gt;http://blog.screv.com/?p=143&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guys at Devstructure have made lots of changes to their service this week, including moving to a completely free model. It&amp;#8217;s an interesting approach to configuration management that&amp;#8217;s worth having a look at of you haven&amp;#8217;t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.devstructure.com/rebooting-devstructure&quot;&gt;http://blog.devstructure.com/rebooting-devstructure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel bad about including the next article as I wrote it, but I reason it&amp;#8217;s interesting to readers of devopsweekly. Even pushing down the time between releases doesn&amp;#8217;t remove all of the risk from rolling out new code, that&amp;#8217;s where smoke testing comes in. This article walks through an example using cucumber and celerity to do fast, headless, tests to check your deployment worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-17-smoke-testing-deployments-using.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-17-smoke-testing-deployments-using.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More headless testing, this time using the Jasmine &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BDD&lt;/span&gt; Javascript framework. This article shows how to wire up Rhino to allow you to run javascript tests without a browser, perfect for continuous integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agile.dzone.com/news/javascript-bdd-jasmine-without&quot;&gt;http://agile.dzone.com/news/javascript-bdd-jasmine-without&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mcollective, the build server orchestration or parallel job execution framework, has just released version 1.0.0. It comes with a few minor features and bug fixes but also marks a change in how the software packages will be made available and versioned in the future. Well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/mcollective-users/browse_thread/thread/9c548d321b159627&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/mcollective-users/browse_thread/thread/9c548d321b159627&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn recently released their deployment automation platform called Glu, which is used to deploy the various different parts of LinkedIn. It&amp;#8217;s written in groovy/java but can apparently be used to deploy anything.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 3 &amp;#8211; 14th December 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the third instalment of Devops Weekly. Thanks for all the support again this week. If you have any news or tools you think people will find interesting do email me at gareth@morethanseven.net&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Devops is definitely the adoption of agile practices by operations teams and it&amp;#8217;s interesting to read about about peoples experience of managing process in a team of systems administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rooflabs.com/2010/12/13/using-agile-to-manage-system-engineering/&quot;&gt;http://www.rooflabs.com/2010/12/13/using-agile-to-manage-system-engineering/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agile Web Operations blog has been putting out a series of Devops posts over the past couple of weeks. The first one this week that caught my eye was John Allspaw&amp;#8217;s post about soft skills and the importance of communication and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-these-soft-parts&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-these-soft-parts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second article is from James Turnbull on why people really shouldn&amp;#8217;t get hung up on the word Devops (as some people appear to do). &amp;#8220;The point is making Ops better – one step at a time – and in the process making our lives easier&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/the-state-of-devops&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/the-state-of-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably my favourite article of the week was this one, on the re-emergance of Systems Engineering as a discipline. I found lots of this described me and, I think, many of the people I meet at Devops events. It also neatly sidesteps the Devops as a role argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1149&quot;&gt;http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1149&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James talked in his article above about his formative years and another post this week caught my eye about experience gained working with smart people and processes. This one covers the importance of source control, staging servers and some lessons learned using them. Good introductory material is hard to write so I&amp;#8217;d love to see more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/12/12/staging-servers-source-control-deploy-workflows-and-other-stuff-nobody-teaches-you/&quot;&gt;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/12/12/staging-servers-source-control-deploy-workflows-and-other-stuff-nobody-teaches-you/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find people sharing details about the tools they use incredible useful, especially when they can include numbers. This great open blog post about using Bacula for backups is exactly the sort of thing I&amp;#8217;d like to see more of. &amp;#8220;A standard 2 week rotation amounts to ~190 TB of data con taining ~490.000.000 files&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.myunix.dk/2010/12/01/large-scale-disk-to-disk-backups-using-bacula/&quot;&gt;http://blog.myunix.dk/2010/12/01/large-scale-disk-to-disk-backups-using-bacula/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before I hit the send button Julian Simpson just published a good interview with the product manager of the Go continuous integration and deployment pipeline too from Thoughtworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.build-doctor.com/2010/12/14/go-thoughtworks-jez-humble/&quot;&gt;http://www.build-doctor.com/2010/12/14/go-thoughtworks-jez-humble/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself looking at different ways of aggregating log files from different systems this week and had chance to investigate a couple of newish open source offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graylog2 is a Java app which stores syslog entries in a MongoDB datastore, along with a good looking Ruby on Rails application for looking at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.graylog2.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.graylog2.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logstash is similar in purpose to Graylog2 but uses ElasticSearch as the backend. It can also aggregate logs from syslog, text files or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AMQP&lt;/span&gt; which might prove useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/logstash/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/logstash/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Issue 2 - 7th December 2010</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 2 &amp;#8211; 7th December 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the feedback since last week. I had a few issues with links being rewritten to be rather on the long side when the final newsletter was sent out. I was hoping to have time this week to get round to resolving but alas the week flew by. The same will happen again this time but I&amp;#8217;ve positioned the links after the text so it should be easier to read. I&amp;#8217;ll probably move to a very simple &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; format as time permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s December which means we have lots of blogs trying to publish a new article every day. One such blog that I found last year and is keeping up the high standard again is &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SYSADVENT&lt;/span&gt;. The pick of the articles for me so far has been this one, talking about using code reviews in operations teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-5-why-arent-you-doing-code-reviews.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-5-why-arent-you-doing-code-reviews.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People interested in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PERFORMANCE&lt;/span&gt; even have their own advent calendar blog, again publishing some really good content already. This article about the need for generalists within software teams I think runs parallel with many of the ideas of devops, at least as I see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2010/the-full-stack/&quot;&gt;http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2010/the-full-stack/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago now a group of about 35 London based developers and ops people met up to talk about &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DEPLOYMENT&lt;/span&gt;. The nice folks at YouDevise let us use a room in their offices and we had at it for a good few hours. The videos taken during the event have just been published and make an educational and occasionally entertaining watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.youdevise.com/YDBlog/index.php/2010/12/01/devops-comes-to-youdevise&quot;&gt;https://dev.youdevise.com/YDBlog/index.php/2010/12/01/devops-comes-to-youdevise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t a new article but I found it interesting coming from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GARTNER&lt;/span&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re working in a large enterprise it can often be tricky to get buy-in for new ideas or ways of working. Having large companies outside the technology sector as well as analyst firms advocating for some of the things we&amp;#8217;re all talking about can only be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.gartner.com/cameron_haight/2010/04/07/the-need-for-it-io-reform/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.gartner.com/cameron_haight/2010/04/07/the-need-for-it-io-reform/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Jones has put together a pretty comprehensive &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SURVEY&lt;/span&gt; around devops. We&amp;#8217;ve seen lots of people writing about what they think devops means, so it should be interested if enough people fill this out to see what a wider group think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekle.id.au/2010/12/devops-survey-2010.html&quot;&gt;http://www.geekle.id.au/2010/12/devops-survey-2010.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HUDSON&lt;/span&gt; project have been having some political issues of late and it&amp;#8217;s good to see them publishing regular updates to the wider community. Continuous Integration plays a big part in quite a few devops ideas and we need a mature open source player in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing&quot;&gt;http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MCOLLECTIVE&lt;/span&gt; has traditionally used ApacheMQ for it&amp;#8217;s messaging needs and several people (myself included) had enquired about whether it could work with RabbitMQ, especially for people that already had that message queue in a production environment. With recent patches to the Stomp adaptor for Rabbit, and this handy tutorial you should be up and running in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 1 &amp;#8211; 30th November 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the first issue of Devops Weekly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been finding Ruby Weekly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyweekly.com/&quot;&gt;http://rubyweekly.com/&lt;/a&gt;), an email newsletter from Peter Cooper, increasingly useful in the last month or so. Something about finding a small amount of high quality content once a week easier to digest than the usual fire hose of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; and Twitter. So I&amp;#8217;m trying the same format out for devops related content. Please email me with anything you think is worth featuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is Devops? I know a number of people have signed up to this newsletter having only recently come across the term. It&amp;#8217;s safe to say Devops means different things to different people at this early stage, but I&amp;#8217;m going to start out by pointing everyone to James Turnbull&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WHAT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DEVOPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MEANS&lt;/span&gt; TO ME (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kartar.net/2010/02/what-devops-means-to-me/&quot;&gt;http://www.kartar.net/2010/02/what-devops-means-to-me/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The much loved &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VELOCITY&lt;/span&gt; conference has put out a call for participation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011/public/cfp/137&quot;&gt;http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011/public/cfp/137&lt;/a&gt;) for next year&amp;#8217;s event. You have until January 11th, 2011 to put together suggestions and submit them. In particular they are looking for talks and panels on NoSQL, mobile performance, effective cloud computing, javaScript speedups, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; optimizations, metrics and monitoring and the impact on the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Holmwood has written an interesting piece this week about all the things happening in Devops recently, in particular whether people are too focused on tools and technologies at the expense of people and communication (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-hijacked-by-technologists&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-hijacked-by-technologists&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related topic Spike Morelli has been writing about the use of the term Devops and how it&amp;#8217;s a useful marketing phrase if we want to spread our experiments and ideas to a wider audience (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spikelab.org/the-word-devops-and-a-marketing-problem/&quot;&gt;http://www.spikelab.org/the-word-devops-and-a-marketing-problem/&lt;/a&gt;). This definitely gels with my own reasons for creating Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Heck just wrote about a new monitoring system he&amp;#8217;s been working on for a year called &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EYES&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2010/11/20/eyes-a-new-monitoring-system/&quot;&gt;http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2010/11/20/eyes-a-new-monitoring-system/&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#8217;s still early days but sounds interesting. The main thrust seems to be that having a monitoring system that is completely &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; driven from the start makes lots of things easier. It uses the Nagios plugin format as well so you should be able to make use of existing plugins easily enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve recently been playing with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUCUMER&lt;/span&gt; for monitoring purposes and it looks like others have too. Jordan Sissel just posted an example of using Cucumber to monitor a Solr instance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/707691&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/707691&lt;/a&gt;) that I found useful. If anyone else has any Cucumber scripts they use for monitoring purposes I&amp;#8217;d love to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One article I came across this week that I found particularly handy was a huge roundup of Linux &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MONITORING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UTILITIES&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/top-linux-monitoring-tools.html&quot;&gt;http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/top-linux-monitoring-tools.html&lt;/a&gt;). I&amp;#8217;d wager most readers will have come across most of the tools on the list but I found it interesting seeing them all listed in one place along with quick examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only came across &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VAGRANT&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://vagrantup.com/&quot;&gt;http://vagrantup.com/&lt;/a&gt;) at the recent devopsdays event in Hamburg but I&amp;#8217;m already finding it indispensable. Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments built around VirtualBox. In my view it massively reduces the barrier to entry for using virtualisation in even small development teams. Worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SCALE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CAMP&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scalecamp.org.uk/&quot;&gt;http://www.scalecamp.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;) is billed as a one-day event for and by people who care about web performance and scalability. It&amp;#8217;s being hosted in London at the offices of The Guardian and if last year&amp;#8217;s event was anything to go by should be a great opportunity to talk about interesting topics with smart people. For those not able to make it along I&amp;#8217;ll try and find as many write ups of the event for a future Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well not really, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DEVOPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BOOKS&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsbooks.com/&quot;&gt;http://devopsbooks.com/&lt;/a&gt;) is another site I just launched collecting recommended reading for anyone interested in Devops topics. I&amp;#8217;m always looking for more book recommendations so please email me with anything I&amp;#8217;m missing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

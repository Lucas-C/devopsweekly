    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 67 &amp;ndash; 15th April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bumper crop of links and tools again this week, with everything from interesting new tools, an epic run of posts with tips on Graphite all from the last week or so and talk of Devops from big companies like IBM and VMWare. The community certainly feels like it&amp;rsquo;s getting bigger every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMWare have released BOSH which they describe as a &amp;ldquo;tool chain for release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services&amp;rdquo;. It took me a while to find some good docs and examples but it certainly looks interesting. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in anyone&amp;rsquo;s experiences with trying this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/documentation/documentation.md&quot;&gt;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/documentation/documentation.md&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-sample-release&quot;&gt;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-sample-release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly interesting seeing the likes of IBM talk about the devops buzz. This piece actually acts as a nice quick introduction for folks in more of an enterprise environment, and contains &amp;ldquo;a small number of concrete practices that are necessary for an enterprise to fully embrace DevOp&amp;rdquo; which actually make useful reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/invisiblethread/entry/6-ways-for-enterprises-to-adopt-devops&quot;&gt;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/invisiblethread/entry/6-ways-for-enterprises-to-adopt-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of how complex systems fail is one of interest to most systems administrators and developers and this post (from last year) makes for an interesting read. It&amp;rsquo;s main point is that &amp;ldquo;People Make Poor Monitors for Computers&amp;rdquo; and although it focuses on the problems with flying airplanes it has lots of good general points and comments worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macroresilience.com/2011/12/29/people-make-poor-monitors-for-computers/&quot;&gt;http://www.macroresilience.com/2011/12/29/people-make-poor-monitors-for-computers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people forget that Vagrantfile&amp;rsquo;s are actually just Ruby code, which means you can do all sorts of project or context specific things in them. This example takes this to quite an extreme, using the same Vagrantfile between projects but along with a project specific configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ergonlogic.com/blog/aegir-vagrant-project-templating-framework&quot;&gt;http://ergonlogic.com/blog/aegir-vagrant-project-templating-framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always happy to see more folks discovering the advantages of virtualised development environments and Vagrant in particular. This post covers a nice story and includes a few of the problems that you can solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mankindforward.com/2012/04/08/why-your-engineering-team-needs-vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://mankindforward.com/2012/04/08/why-your-engineering-team-needs-vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite is awesome. I&amp;rsquo;ve only more recently had chance to really get into using it and, although it&amp;rsquo;s immediately useful it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that some of it&amp;rsquo;s more powerful features will take time to learn. This excellent series, with 6 posts already this month, is well worth checking out for tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcollective is a fantastic framework for remote execution but it does require some upfront effort for writing plugins. This post quickly walks through writing a smile agent which wraps an existing command line tool. Very handy if you&amp;rsquo;re moving from a ssh loop based approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mague.com/?p=382&quot;&gt;http://blog.mague.com/?p=382&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience DNS tends to be one of those things that all those coming from a systems administration background understand and those from more of a developer background done. That makes this blog post hugely useful, as well as well written and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://css.dzone.com/articles/devops-dns-developers&quot;&gt;http://css.dzone.com/articles/devops-dns-developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shazam Entertainment is looking to fill a number of Service Engineering roles in our London HQ and Palo Alto office. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for passionate individuals who enjoy building and operating highly reliable services by working closely with development to design and implement strong systems architectures, CI methodologies, and insane amounts of monitoring.  We also have a number of positions in our Infrastructure Operations team for those less interested in development and more interested in network engineering, building and operating private clouds, and focusing on third party software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details or to apply send on your CV/Resume or LinkedIn profile to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#100;&amp;#x65;&amp;#118;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#112;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x40;&amp;#115;&amp;#104;&amp;#97;&amp;#122;&amp;#97;&amp;#109;&amp;#x74;&amp;#101;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#99;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&quot;&gt;&amp;#100;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x76;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#112;&amp;#115;&amp;#64;&amp;#115;&amp;#104;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x7a;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#x61;&amp;#109;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone likes the perceived complexity of Chef or Puppet and lots of smaller shell script based frameworks seem to crop up that deal only with provisioning rather than everything else. Sunzi is one that caught my eye that has a few nice features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kenn/sunzi&quot;&gt;https://github.com/kenn/sunzi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load testing tools tend to have a bit of a barrier to entry, at least if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get useful data past the number of requests per second an individual URL can handle. Locust therefore looks interesting. Define tests in Python (similar to Funkload) but along with a very nice web based results dashboard and some distributed test running features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/cgbystrom/p/load-testing-with-locust&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/cgbystrom/p/load-testing-with-locust&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://locust.io/&quot;&gt;http://locust.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks are releasing their in-house deployment tools, which is great for picking through code and finding ideas. I&amp;rsquo;m sure at some point we&amp;rsquo;ll see a consolidation too. Brood is a PHP, XML and Gearman based tool which has just been released by IGN and might be worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.ign.com/blog/2012/04/01/continuous-deployment-with-brood&quot;&gt;http://code.ign.com/blog/2012/04/01/continuous-deployment-with-brood&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ign/brood&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ign/brood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting looking project, Metis is an implementation of the Nagios NRPE daemon written in Ruby. The emphasis appears to be on getting people to share and test monitoring code which is a worthy goal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 66 &amp;ndash; 8th April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly larger issue this week which should hopefully keep people going through the long weekend. And for anyone thinking about a change of jobs there is and a cheeky opportunity to come and work with me at the Government Digital Service :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting details of how the operations team at Spotify adopted a Kanban approach to managing there work. Nice to see information about the tools used as well as how they went about adopting and deciding upon the approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/articles/kanban-operations-spotify&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/articles/kanban-operations-spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice write-up of combining an existing syslog infrastructure with Graphite to gets logs of everything. The argument made is that if you&amp;rsquo;re already using syslog elsewhere you should need very few new moving parts to start gathering data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickflop.net/blog/2012/03/30/any-metric-graphing-with-graphite-and-syslog/&quot;&gt;http://www.kickflop.net/blog/2012/03/30/any-metric-graphing-with-graphite-and-syslog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more people are starting to post about their current monitoring setups. Not only does this make for good looking blog posts (graphs!) but most of them contain interesting tips and tricks that are worth experimenting with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2012-04-02-metrics-monitoring-infrastructure-oh-my/&quot;&gt;http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2012-04-02-metrics-monitoring-infrastructure-oh-my/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure testing is still relatively new to most people and this introductory talk by Jon Topper at the recent CukeUp event might be a useful starting point. It demonstrates a number of tools including cucumber-nagios and talks about some of the current problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/test-driven-infrastructure-cucumber&quot;&gt;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/test-driven-infrastructure-cucumber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good lighting fast slide deck on two main points of interest in operations; metrics collection and monitoring. Quick examples of good and bad log examples, approaches to common problems and things you can do to make running software easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/the-unnamed-talk&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/the-unnamed-talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short interview with Patrick Debois about the State of Devops. The questions vary from where the movement came from to what is currently of interest at the moment. Interesting, but brief, discussion of a monitoring abstraction interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/debois-devops&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/debois-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good lengthy article going inside how Facebook release software to production. It includes both technical and process details and is worth a read. Although it contains technical details it&amp;rsquo;s also friendly enough to share with more business minded colleagues. And it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see the people behind the technology too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering.ars&quot;&gt;http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering.ars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays Austin was last week and this post gave me a feeling of being there without describing the individual talks (which should be available online at some point). Lots of nice take aways from removing the hero and the villain, the move towards automation and rapid release and the interesting but so simple idea of unit tests for production security assertions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://undertitled.com/2012/04/05/devopsdays-takeaways.html&quot;&gt;http://undertitled.com/2012/04/05/devopsdays-takeaways.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram launched a new service last week and blogged about some of the tools and techniques they used on launch day. The takeaways are good, including good real time monitoring, the ability to identify where in the stack a bottleneck is occurring and doing the capacity planning and provisioning extra read capacity ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/20541814340/keeping-instagram-up-with-over-a-million-new-users-in&quot;&gt;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/20541814340/keeping-instagram-up-with-over-a-million-new-users-in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud East is a new conference focused on all things Cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s being held on the 28th of June in Cambridge, UK, which happens to be where I live. I&amp;rsquo;d love to meet up with any readers who are planning on heading along. They are also on the lookout for speakers for a variety of different sessions including tutorials, workshops and panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudeast.net&quot;&gt;http://www.cloudeast.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shameless self promotion this week I&amp;rsquo;m afraid. I&amp;rsquo;m currently hiring for sysadmin, web operations and #devops minded folks to work with me at the UK Government Digital Service. The roles are brand new and will involve everything from deployment tooling, automation and configuration management to lots of pairing with developers, security assurance and managing production systems. Any questions let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2336682&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/2336682&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm is a distributed realtime computation system, which may be of interest to a few folks. Also particularly interesting is the related deployment system. It&amp;rsquo;s built on top of Pallet, the clojure automation tool and provides a nice example repo to wander through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-deploy&quot;&gt;https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-deploy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wham looks like an interesting prototype. A very cryptic home page where you need to know what it&amp;rsquo;s for, if you enter a public GitHub repository name containing puppet modules and manifests you get a dependency graph. Try emtrane/puppet-repo for instance. Nice idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wham.cloudsmith.com/&quot;&gt;http://wham.cloudsmith.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wham.cloudsmith.com/whamgraph?repository=emtrane%2Fpuppet-repo&quot;&gt;http://wham.cloudsmith.com/whamgraph?repository=emtrane%2Fpuppet-repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 65 &amp;ndash; 1st April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Devopsdays event of the year kicks off tomorrow, and with it hopefully lots of events where people can get together in one place and talk to each other. What devops means to me has always been best exemplified by the people I&amp;rsquo;ve met and talked to at such events, and when people take a line (devops is a developer land grab, none of these people work with systems at scale) I encourage them to go along and get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super interesting post from someone working in community management, about the overlaps between her world and that of operations and devops. Some nice examples and parallels, and a subtle call to team up and make things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://venessapaech.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/devops-and-strategic-alliances/&quot;&gt;http://venessapaech.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/devops-and-strategic-alliances/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Days Austin is just around the corner (Monday 2nd and Tuesday 3rd of April in fact) and for those that can&amp;rsquo;t make it the organisers and sponsors have arranged for live video streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmc.com/videos/live/devopdays_austin2012.html&quot;&gt;http://www.bmc.com/videos/live/devopdays_austin2012.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of blog posts appeared this week summarising a recent mailing list thread. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting because it gets to what devops is, or at least what we as a community would like it to be perceived as. The line &amp;ldquo;For Devops to succeed we must focus on squishy stuff first, technical details second.&amp;rdquo; I wholeheartedly agree with, but know from putting this newsletter together each week it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find interesting content on tools and processes. More &amp;ldquo;squishy stuff&amp;rdquo; would definitely be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/DevopsPerceptions&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/DevopsPerceptions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spikelab.org/devops-notjust-configuration-management/&quot;&gt;http://www.spikelab.org/devops-notjust-configuration-management/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualising networks of nodes is interesting, until you get to so many nodes that all sense breaks down. It turns out this is called a hairball in some graph circles, and this blog post describes the problems and a few potential solutions. I&amp;rsquo;d certainly be interested in tools based on these ideas for infrastructure visualisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eagereyes.org/techniques/graphs-hairball&quot;&gt;http://eagereyes.org/techniques/graphs-hairball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice quick writeup of the custom file server that GitHub uses. Mainly interesting to see the different graphs used for monitoring an application of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1089-nodeload-metrics&quot;&gt;https://github.com/blog/1089-nodeload-metrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing operations goals in terms of developer and sprint friendly terminology definitely feels like a good idea, and this post lists some high level goals broken down into availability, performance, support, security and deployment. It would be nice to see these fleshed out with details and patterns for making them happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2012/03/28/service-delivery-best-practices/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2012/03/28/service-delivery-best-practices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops is still a very new movement/term and lots more people are finding it (and this newsletter) every week. For those in the position it&amp;rsquo;s worth a little history lesson about where this all started to coalesce into a thing &amp;ndash; and this blog post does that. The argument that three things, agile infrastructure, velocity and lean, came together is made nicely, and it&amp;rsquo;s a good read of those that wonder about such things and weren&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itrevolution.com/the-convergence-of-devops/&quot;&gt;http://itrevolution.com/the-convergence-of-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of 16 common unix monitoring utilities. The long time systems administrators reading will be more than familiar with these but those new to operations roles, especially coming from a development background, should find it interesting and a good list of tools to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://h30565.www3.hp.com/t5/Feature-Articles/16-Linux-Server-Monitoring-Commands-You-Really-Need-To-Know/ba-p/1936&quot;&gt;http://h30565.www3.hp.com/t5/Feature-Articles/16-Linux-Server-Monitoring-Commands-You-Really-Need-To-Know/ba-p/1936&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectacular looks like an interesting, and very quick, way of taking a look at SNMP data from your router. Just install the gem, point it at the router and you&amp;rsquo;ll get a nice browser based interface to watch traffic on the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tenderlove/spectacular&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tenderlove/spectacular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kibana is an alternative user interface for Logstash, the log aggregation and visualisation tool. It&amp;rsquo;s nicely documented with big pictures of the UI and some of the features like the trend analysis look particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rashidkpc.github.com/Kibana/about.html&quot;&gt;http://rashidkpc.github.com/Kibana/about.html&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 64 &amp;ndash; 25th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just back from Edinburgh after a fun and informative few days at PuppetCamp Edinburgh. Hi to all the folks who made it along. I got a chance to run through a talk on using the data buried inside your configuration management tool for things like reporting, eliminating multiple sources of truth and visualisation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/mining-puppet.&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/mining-puppet.&lt;/a&gt; Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people do appear to get confused over the term Devops. This post tries to cover some of those areas for confusion and address them one by one. Worth reading for when you wander into similar conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2012/03/13/what-is-devops-not/&quot;&gt;http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2012/03/13/what-is-devops-not/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did anyone mention that naming things is hard? This post from Adrian Cockcroft of Netflix is interesting for a number of reasons but I found the descriptions of how Netflix operate the most insightful. Some good comments and replies too. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in cloud operations at scale it&amp;rsquo;s worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://perfcap.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html&quot;&gt;http://perfcap.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Alspaw from Etsy responded with a long followup to the above post, going into some detail about the reasons why some folks don&amp;rsquo;t like the NoOps terminology. Again I found this more interesting for the insight about how Etsy work and organise themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2140086&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/2140086&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re developing code that will be distributed for multiple distributions then testing can be irritating. This post covers a neat way of testing Chef cookbooks across multiple distros using Vagrant &amp;ndash; by defining multiple virtual machines in the Vagrantfile. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple pattern, and one that would be useful for more than just configuration management testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/03/18/multivm-vagrantfile-for-chef/&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/03/18/multivm-vagrantfile-for-chef/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not often I come across interesting Windows content, partly because I don&amp;rsquo;t find myself using it very often. But whenever I do it&amp;rsquo;s nearly always something about powershell. This article covers a nice idea, using a script to generate a regular report of data from across a group of servers. Includes an example, the working code and a good walk through of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/building-a-daily-systems-report-email-with-powershell/&quot;&gt;http://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/building-a-daily-systems-report-email-with-powershell/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Food Fight podcast is back again and becoming more regular it seems. This episode goes into some detail about reusability of configuration management code and in particular applying good object orientated patterns to Chef recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/03/episode-6-cookbook-reusability-with.html&quot;&gt;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/03/episode-6-cookbook-reusability-with.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Puppet Camp this last week one of the talks, by Matt Carroll of Future Publishing was particularly interesting. These slides tell a good story of an evolving technical organisation and go into some details of how they came to love publish/subscribe tools via the use of mcollective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://oholiab.goatse.co.uk/puppetcamp.html&quot;&gt;http://oholiab.goatse.co.uk/puppetcamp.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skewer is another tool to make using Puppet without the central puppetmaster easier. It features integration with fog for creating EC2 and Rackspace Cloud instances, as well as a bootstrap to install Puppet&amp;rsquo;s dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 63 &amp;ndash; 18th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to see lots of content around devops makes for a great excuse to try and spot patterns. Lots of previous articles and several this issue  are encouraging, lots of smart people seeking inspiration from other more mature fields. Definitely lots still to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting article about some of the changes around moving to a public cloud. Good points that, for certain software stacks at least, the unlimited capacity available can be used to work around all sorts of problems but at a financial cost. The idea of a cost aware SLA is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ukelson.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/cloud-operations-1-the-frontal-lobe/&quot;&gt;http://ukelson.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/cloud-operations-1-the-frontal-lobe/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etsy have talked before about their desire to have new starters commit code to production on day one. This new post covers the internal infrastructure they have in place to let that happen safely. Interesting that they use a central virtualisation setup using KVM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brice Figureau continues his one-man effort to document the inner workings of puppet. This post in the series is about the compiler and how it transforms the details of the node and the code you write into a catalog to be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2012/03/17/puppet-internals-the-compiler/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2012/03/17/puppet-internals-the-compiler/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NoOps debate still rages but I&amp;rsquo;ve seen very few positive posts worth including. This one however makes a few good points on the topic. For a taster the post and comments include lines like &amp;ldquo;I don’t feel like it’s helping us define where we want to go&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;either you&amp;rsquo;re missing part of my point, or else we&amp;rsquo;re in violent agreement&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ingineering.it/post/19383804543/devops-vs-noops-misses-the-point&quot;&gt;http://blog.ingineering.it/post/19383804543/devops-vs-noops-misses-the-point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great slide desk on the similarities between devops and the workings of a Formula 1 racing team. Lots of good examples and points about things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/StephenBurton_WhatCanDevOpsLearnFromFormula1.pdf&quot;&gt;http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/StephenBurton_WhatCanDevOpsLearnFromFormula1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typesafe have released a console for there integrated scala, play and akka framework and it does look rather nice. The accompanying blog post covers some of the rationale any how certain features can be used to isolate production problems. The online is nice to explore too. I&amp;rsquo;d love to see an open source framework for building interactive dashboards like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.typesafe.com/introducing-typesafe-console&quot;&gt;http://blog.typesafe.com/introducing-typesafe-console&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://console-demo.typesafe.com/&quot;&gt;http://console-demo.typesafe.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the presentations that caught my eye from the recent Qcon was this one on ensuring resilient responses in complex systems. Lots of notes from academic literature and interesting looking books plus loads of real world examples and things you can do to make your applications more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/resilient-response-in-complex-systems&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/resilient-response-in-complex-systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nervous aims to provide the building blocks for building your own monitoring systems. It&amp;rsquo;s a node.js framework based around a simple plugin architecture and provides a simple way for sending data to Graphite too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gflarity/nervous&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gflarity/nervous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails default logging can be useful while developing applications but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty annoying when it comes to production applications. Lograge is an attempt to fix that, extracted from the Travis CI codebase. It takes the multiline logging and changes everything to one line per request.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 62 &amp;ndash; 11th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first story this week is the news of the 1.0 release of Vagrant. I just wanted to say a personal thank you to Mitchell and everyone else involved in the development and evangelism of a particularly useful part of mine, and many others, development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big release this last week, Vagrant has hit 1.0. This is an important release as the format for the Vagrantfile will now be supported for the foreseeable future. The recommended installation method has also changed, with native installers shipping for a large number of different platforms. Huge congratulations to Mitchell Hashimoto and everyone else involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vagrantup.com/?v1&quot;&gt;http://vagrantup.com/?v1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto, of Vagrant fame, has written a nice summary of 2 years hard work on open source software. Lots of good insights and advice for anyone involved or wanting to get involved in open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitchellhashimoto.com/post/18870472135/hardest-and-most-rewarding-job&quot;&gt;http://mitchellhashimoto.com/post/18870472135/hardest-and-most-rewarding-job&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good lucking presentation about a number of places where operations kills and awareness are particularly useful for developers. Lots of details about approaches to logging, metrics collection, java packaging and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/chids/p/the-ops-side-of-dev-2012-03-02&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/chids/p/the-ops-side-of-dev-2012-03-02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting description of the problem with making configuration management code reusable. I have to agree with the general theme, that this is no-where near a solved problem. Some good examples of how traditional object orientated software practices could be applied to the problem too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nistu.de/2012/03/04/reusability-in-configuration-management-systems/&quot;&gt;http://blog.nistu.de/2012/03/04/reusability-in-configuration-management-systems/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup from a talk by Gene Kim, author of Visible Ops. Nicely summarising devops, in particular the letters to stakeholders section which has bullet point advice for different groups; developers, testers, operations, designers and product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.williamhertling.com/2012/03/when-it-says-no-creating-fast-feature.html&quot;&gt;http://www.williamhertling.com/2012/03/when-it-says-no-creating-fast-feature.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing configuration management code is still in most places a new idea, with new tools and approaches still being worked out. This example I found interesting, it runs a command after a puppet run which runs a series of tests and emails failures. The tests themselves are defined as nagios checks and interestingly defined alongside your puppet resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example42.com/?q=TestingPuppetWithPuppi&quot;&gt;http://www.example42.com/?q=TestingPuppetWithPuppi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of the future of systems administration appears to be a recurring one, and this post makes a case for specialisation and in particular different types of admin. Makes some point about this being the case now in places and that other industries or shops will move in that direction over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2012/03/the-coming-future-of-system-administration/&quot;&gt;http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2012/03/the-coming-future-of-system-administration/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m seeing more and more tools being built around Graphite, which can only be a good thing. Response acts as a proxy for graphite, and features a plugin system to act on incoming data. The example alerting plugins look interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gflarity/response&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gflarity/response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard::Knife looks a handy tool which can automatically trigger knife commands when your Chef cookbook files change. Useful if you find yourself constantly saving and then uploading to your Chef server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nistude/guard-knife&quot;&gt;https://github.com/nistude/guard-knife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 61 &amp;ndash; 4th March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick thank you to two tools instead of a proper introduction this week. Without Instapaper (for collecting links during the week whether I&amp;rsquo;m at a computer or from my phone) and without Mailchimp (for sorting all the subscriptions and sending the email) I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Devops Weekly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have got this far. So thanks to both services for being awesome. Right, on with the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s useful to have a list to start from when setting up or improving infrastructure. This list breaks down into provisioning, configuration management, deployment, orchestration, monitoring, log management, process supervision and security/auditing and briefly describes each. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this list at work I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ranjib.posterous.com/infrastructure-tooling-patterns&quot;&gt;http://ranjib.posterous.com/infrastructure-tooling-patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not new but it was recommended to me just last week, this free PDF book covers DNS in exacting detail (it comes in at 747 pages). Looks well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jpmens.net/2010/10/29/alternative-dns-servers-the-book-as-pdf/&quot;&gt;http://jpmens.net/2010/10/29/alternative-dns-servers-the-book-as-pdf/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly simple approach to backing up Jenkins configuration using git and cron. Easy to alter for whatever backup approach you use too, the secret is in the example .gitignore file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1919354&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/1919354&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup of one organisations adoption of devops ideas, in particular to help improve the quality and maintainability of deployed software. I think it&amp;rsquo;s missing a few things, in particular a push towards smaller and more regular deployments, and some mention that it&amp;rsquo;s not just pre-deployment that can benefit from cross team communication but the whole development process. But the detail is all interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/Using-DevOps-approaches-for-pre-release-and-production-software-quality&quot;&gt;http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/Using-DevOps-approaches-for-pre-release-and-production-software-quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services has lots of individual components, one of which that often seems to lead to misunderstandings is ELB, the load balancing service. This article from Amazon covers lots of technical details especially useful for anyone with experience of other load balancing technologies. It details the architecture as well as possible testing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1636185810492479&quot;&gt;http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1636185810492479&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good detailed post about a rigorous pursuit of speedy build and test runs. Lots of technical details specific to Java and JVM environments, but also lots of general principles about why and how to go about getting serious about build performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dan.bodar.com/2012/02/28/crazy-fast-build-times-or-when-10-seconds-starts-to-make-you-nervous/&quot;&gt;http://dan.bodar.com/2012/02/28/crazy-fast-build-times-or-when-10-seconds-starts-to-make-you-nervous/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logs are always interesting, and this post gives a brief overview of how different platform as a service offerings deal with them. In particular it details what logs are available from Engine Yard, including lots of links to posts about how you might go about analysing the contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://logentries.com/blog/2012/02/digging-into-engineyard-logs/&quot;&gt;https://logentries.com/blog/2012/02/digging-into-engineyard-logs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastically illustrated post about what it means to Netflix to be fault tolerant. The scale at which Netflix are operating is pretty extreme, but lots of the theory is applicable to smaller systems too. The break down of what to do from a user point of view when part of a distributed system fails is particularly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/fault-tolerance-in-high-volume.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/fault-tolerance-in-high-volume.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure how I&amp;rsquo;ve not come across Riemann until now. It&amp;rsquo;s billed as a networking monitoring system for distributed systems. It&amp;rsquo;s built to process streams of inputs, often sent from within applications over TCP or UDP. It can forward to graphite as well as email for specific events. More interesting are the protocol buffer based API and the example dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/&quot;&gt;http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aphyr/riemann&quot;&gt;https://github.com/aphyr/riemann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toft is similar to Vagrant in that it provides a simple set of command line tools for managing virtual machines. The difference is that it uses LXC containers rather than virtualbox, which does mean it only works on Linux but also means it&amp;rsquo;s very fast to start or destroy containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/exceedhl/toft&quot;&gt;https://github.com/exceedhl/toft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people have been experimenting with different ways of testing configuration management tools using virtual machines and this vagrant plugin attempts to make it easier to do so. Just define what tests you want to run in your vagrantfile and the plugin gives you a command to run both tests on the guest and on the host.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 60 &amp;ndash; 26th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weekend, and another devopsweekly issue filled with hopefully worthwhile articles and a few interesting tools. Do let me know what you think about the mix of content each week, or if you feel the email is missing anything in particular. Drop me a line at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#x67;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x68;&amp;#64;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x76;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#46;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x65;&amp;#116;&quot;&gt;&amp;#103;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#x76;&amp;#101;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&lt;/a&gt; with any ideas you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Cafe is back this week with a new episode. John and Damon chat with Jordan Sissel about his work on fpm, logstash and more. Some good discussion in particular around the state of commercial and open source log management software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2012/2/25/devops-cafe-episode-22.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2012/2/25/devops-cafe-episode-22.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting writeup about running into a scaling issue with puppet and some of the complexities of a real world setup using puppet, passenger and apt-cache. Attempting to get everything to call in at the same time is tricky so some useful tips here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomoconnor.eu/blogish/puppet-apt-and-our-very-own-thundering-herd/&quot;&gt;http://tomoconnor.eu/blogish/puppet-apt-and-our-very-own-thundering-herd/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opscode, the nice folks behind Chef, have released their excellent training material under an open source license and put the content and code up on GitHub. Interesting writeup too of moving from Keynote to Markdown, and the ultimate goal of making the next session benefit from the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/02/23/open-source-training-materials/&quot;&gt;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/02/23/open-source-training-materials/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opscode/chef-fundamentals&quot;&gt;https://github.com/opscode/chef-fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good slide deck about mining all the data available from your infrastructure. Some nice examples of mapping metrics to configuration management tools and some ideas for dealing with graphs and logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/RanjibDey/spit-gather-churn-mining-infrastructure-data-for-ops-intelligence&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/RanjibDey/spit-gather-churn-mining-infrastructure-data-for-ops-intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to squeeze more performance out of your MySQL setup then this whitepaper from the Percona folk, MySQL Performance Analysis with Percona Toolkit and TCP/IP Network Traffic, might be of interest. Goes into lots of low level details if you&amp;rsquo;re at the point of optimising network level traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.percona.com/about-us/mysql-white-paper/mysql-performance-analysis-with-percona-toolkit-and-tcp-ip-network-traffic/&quot;&gt;http://www.percona.com/about-us/mysql-white-paper/mysql-performance-analysis-with-percona-toolkit-and-tcp-ip-network-traffic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot to include this last week so folks have probably seen it, but just in case. An excellent in-depth technical article about how Tumblr works. Covers a huge range of what software and hardware they use and why, along with some particularly interesting numbers and what they are doing now to solve specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/2/13/tumblr-architecture-15-billion-page-views-a-month-and-harder.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/2/13/tumblr-architecture-15-billion-page-views-a-month-and-harder.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the particularly interesting talks at FOSDEM was the wikipedia open source infrastructure talk. This writeup of the talk covers a lot of ground and picks a few of the particularly interesting success stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lwn.net/Articles/480002/&quot;&gt;http://lwn.net/Articles/480002/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix are making increasing use of Cassandra and are releasing various open source tools they&amp;rsquo;ve built to deal with a very large deployment. Priam looks particularly interesting, providing backup and recovery, bootstrapping and automated token assignment, centralized configuration management and interestingly a RESTful monitoring and metrics package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/announcing-priam.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/announcing-priam.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayfair, a Boston based 500 million dollar e-commerce company, is looking to grow our systems administration team by bringing on board talented individuals seeking broad exposure to the technologies that support our infrastructure and our large-scale Internet e-commerce platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wayfair.com/careers#dept=engineering&amp;amp;job=oGMQVfwX&quot;&gt;http://www.wayfair.com/careers#dept=engineering&amp;amp;job=oGMQVfwX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperdex is yet another key-value store, but it does appear to add an interesting feature to the mix, specifically optimisation for search and search primitives. The performance benchmarks look promising too, I&amp;rsquo;d certainly be interested in finding anyone running this in anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hyperdex.org/&quot;&gt;http://hyperdex.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amon is an interesting looking logging and exception tracking dashboard. It&amp;rsquo;s a Python and MongoDB application but ships with support for Rails, Django and Node.js apps and the screenshot at least makes it look pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 59 &amp;ndash; 19th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good week for discussion and debate this last week. In particular the Devops google group suddenly came to life with several worthwhile threads on job titles and organisation names, and whether networking knowledge is a key skill for everyone. If you&amp;rsquo;re not already subscribed then take a look &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/devops.&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/devops.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t generally include negative content but this Reddit thread has some interesting discussions hidden amongst. The original blog post appears to have disappeared, but what I find most interesting is some of the preconceived ideas about Devops. Knowing some of the arguments against makes making coherent arguments for easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pp860/why_i_hate_the_word_devops/&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pp860/why_i_hate_the_word_devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foodfight podcast is back with another episode, this one featuring some FOSDEM roundup, discussions with John E. Vincent and some Chef community news. Worth a listen even if you&amp;rsquo;re not using Chef as the content is broader than just a single tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/02/episode-3-usrbinruby-for-sysadmins-with.html&quot;&gt;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/02/episode-3-usrbinruby-for-sysadmins-with.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neat idea for versioning DNS records in Git. The example uses the dnsimple API, but you could do exactly the same with any good DNS provider with an API. Would be nice to see this automated, or maybe even a DNS vendor allow access to records as a git repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://support.dnsimple.com/discussions/suggestions/51-how-to-view-domain-record-diffs-in-git&quot;&gt;http://support.dnsimple.com/discussions/suggestions/51-how-to-view-domain-record-diffs-in-git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of talk recently about the use of the word Devops in job titles. This post makes a strong case that, used as a qualifier, it makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spikelab.org/devops-job-title/&quot;&gt;http://www.spikelab.org/devops-job-title/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This OASIS standards group are working on a Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications. The aims are portability and interoperable, but the tools being used are XML and large vendors. Depending on your interests it be worth reading through the existing specification for ideas and maybe how concepts are named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca&quot;&gt;http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting case study from Fotopedia focused on their use of MongoDB and MySQL. Mainly focuses on what they have learned moving some data from MySQL to Mongo, with details of why they did it and what they liked best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/17155176484/mongodb-vs-mysql-a-devops-point-of-view&quot;&gt;http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/17155176484/mongodb-vs-mysql-a-devops-point-of-view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice summary of #monitoring sucks, in response to the idea that it was really just some sort of marketing scheme. Lots of good related links here as well as details of why monitoring really does suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://solarce.org/2012/02/12/why-monitoring-sucks-or-the-future-is-a-toolbox/&quot;&gt;http://solarce.org/2012/02/12/why-monitoring-sucks-or-the-future-is-a-toolbox/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good article focusing on practices for low risk software releases. Covering canary releases, feature switching, approaches to minimising the need for rollbacks. Nothing new for those at the cutting edge, but a good place to start or to convince sceptical management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1833567&quot;&gt;http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1833567&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppet Labs continues to grow and are hiring both a Senior Professional Services Engineer and a Senior Sales Engineer to join our Technical Operations team. Senior Professional Services Engineers help our Puppet Labs' customers succeed through training, consulting, and custom development engagements, as well as further Puppet Labs product growth with direct customer feedback. Our new Senior Sales Engineer will act as technical evangelist by providing advanced technical pre-sales support, communicating the technical and business value proposition of Puppet Labs’ products for client engagements, and speaking at events. Please note, these two roles may be based anywhere in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/jobs&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely no information available at this stage but Devopsdays will be back in Europe in October again, this time it&amp;rsquo;s heading to Italy. The organisers are on the look out for anyone interested in helping out too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFT looks very interesting. The idea is pretty simple; a command line app which remembers the resulting actions of commands you type and allows you to export them as Puppet manifests. Potentially a nice easy way of learning Puppet syntax or generating simple manifests quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cft.et.redhat.com/&quot;&gt;http://cft.et.redhat.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t wanted a full size set of traffic lights wired up to their continuous integration server? Well here&amp;rsquo;s a nice project (including circuit diagrams, Arduino details and a small Ruby script that does just that. Where you get hold of the traffic lights I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johndavid400/Isotope11_traffic_lights&quot;&gt;https://github.com/johndavid400/Isotope11_traffic_lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2012/02/12/issue-58/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 58 &amp;ndash; 12th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hopefully good set of blog posts this week, with many focused on people writing about their work infrastructure or stories about a particular incident. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just because I&amp;rsquo;ve become better at finding this sort of content, but it feels to me like hand in hand with the whole devops thing has come much more openness about infrastructure and how we build these networks and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent, detailed post about how to go about introducing a new programming language into an organisation. Having been involved in similar, though smaller, transitions this advice is well worth reading and I think is as relevant to systems administrators moving from just bash scripts as it is to developers moving from Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/01/lessons-learned-while-introducing-new.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/01/lessons-learned-while-introducing-new.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice to see a different take on some of the implications of continuous deployment, this post covers the case of paid for software, and the clash between continuous deployment and charging for a new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ayende.com/blog/154689/the-economics-of-continuous-deployment&quot;&gt;http://ayende.com/blog/154689/the-economics-of-continuous-deployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postmortem&amp;rsquo;s for incidents can be hugely beneficial both for avoiding future issues and for institutional learning. However this blog post argues against stressing the root cause, stating that for complex systems there often isn&amp;rsquo;t one single cause. Lots of interesting points and further academic reading for those particularly interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/02/10/each-necessary-but-only-jointly-sufficient/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/02/10/each-necessary-but-only-jointly-sufficient/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed stories from inside organisations are always interesting. This one describes the infrastructure setup at 99designs. I&amp;rsquo;d wager this is quite a typical setup so is probably a good read for folks who are just learning how to grow their small web application and maybe want to know what it might look like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://99designs.com/tech-blog/blog/2012/01/30/infrastructure-at-99designs/&quot;&gt;http://99designs.com/tech-blog/blog/2012/01/30/infrastructure-at-99designs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good story post, this about a particular event &amp;ndash; needing to scale up a small application very rapidly. It&amp;rsquo;s worth reading, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve not been involved in anything similar before. Integrating this sort of testing and working into your ongoing development process is important if you&amp;rsquo;re not going to run into a similar hard deadline too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.williamhertling.com/2012/02/scaling-web-app-1000x-in-3-days.html&quot;&gt;http://www.williamhertling.com/2012/02/scaling-web-app-1000x-in-3-days.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love hanging automation off Puppet&amp;rsquo;s stored configuration database, but deleting nodes in a highly dynamic environment can be irritating. This post and associated code shows one way of solving this problem in an OpenStack environment using the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://geek.jasonhancock.com/2012/02/06/removing-destroyed-cloudstack-instances-from-puppet-stored-configurations-db/&quot;&gt;http://geek.jasonhancock.com/2012/02/06/removing-destroyed-cloudstack-instances-from-puppet-stored-configurations-db/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a question left unanswered in one of the talks at FOSDEM and a bit of rapid hacking Puppet now has a new way of describing manifests: XML. I was genuinely going to do this for the April 1st issue too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unethicalblogger.com/2012/02/08/puppet-xml-a-brand-new-synergy.html&quot;&gt;http://unethicalblogger.com/2012/02/08/puppet-xml-a-brand-new-synergy.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtyler/puppet/tree/puppetxml&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rtyler/puppet/tree/puppetxml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After FOSDEM last weekend several people headed off to Antwerp for a monitoring themed hack day and workshop. Lots of whiteboarding ensued, as well as discussions of the increasing utility of logstash for  passing all the data around effectively. Sorry I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/we-didnt-fix-it&quot;&gt;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/we-didnt-fix-it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last a little self-promotion. At work as well as building a new development team inside the UK Government we&amp;rsquo;ve been building a culture of dashboards on large screens. I&amp;rsquo;m always interested to see other organisations dashboards and finally got round to a blog post about ours. If anyone else has similar pictures of posts I&amp;rsquo;d love to see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/02/08/radiating-information/&quot;&gt;http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/02/08/radiating-information/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack appears to be picking up speed, case studies and fans pretty quickly. But having a play with your own personal cloud feels a little difficult. That&amp;rsquo;s where DevStack comes in. Good documentation and a series of scripts to get you setup with a local environment. It&amp;rsquo;s not intended for production deployments, more for development and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devstack.org/&quot;&gt;http://devstack.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2012/02/05/issue-57/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 57 &amp;ndash; 5th February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weeks issue comes direct from FOSDEM. I&amp;rsquo;m currently chatting about monitoring and related perils with Patrick Debois, Mitchell Hashimoto and a bunch of other equally smart folks. The configuration management room has been interesting so far, and the cloud devroom yesterday had some interesting talks too. FOSDEM is definitely the place to be this weekend it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems administration is changing, and this post makes quite a strong argument that for many if not most sysadmins the future is about automation, configuration management and disposable virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/DevopsIsHereWhetherYouLikeItOrNot&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/DevopsIsHereWhetherYouLikeItOrNot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else I saw in a talk at FOSDEM this weekend, this online app lets you calculate or play around with the measure of availability for your system based on the mean time between failure and mean time to recovery values. A nice way of highlighting the importance of what needs to happen to improve availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/reliability_calculator/&quot;&gt;http://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/reliability_calculator/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather ominously titled post, but one that&amp;rsquo;s not as negative as it appears. I particularly like the focus on how the same words are often used to describe different things by different groups &amp;ldquo;would ops define an “application” in Puppet the same way dev would define an “application” in Hudson&amp;rdquo;? Without sharing terminology modelling dependencies across tools becomes much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skydingo.com/blog/2012/01/why-devops-is-doomed-ops-teams-are-lost-1-of-3/&quot;&gt;http://skydingo.com/blog/2012/01/why-devops-is-doomed-ops-teams-are-lost-1-of-3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zynga has a number of unusual requirements when it comes to managing it&amp;rsquo;s game servers. This post, although light on technical details, talks a little about how they are using ZooKeeper to make configuration changes across the entire fleet in under a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.zynga.com/2011/08/updating-thousands-of-configuration-files-in-under-a-second/&quot;&gt;http://code.zynga.com/2011/08/updating-thousands-of-configuration-files-in-under-a-second/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using continuous integration systems to do more than just run a test suite against your code is becoming more and more common, this example takes a web.config configuration file for a .NET project and runs a large number of security checks against it. This approach has a number of advantages, in particular meaning once you&amp;rsquo;ve fixed the highlighted issues they stay fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dotnet.dzone.com/articles/continuous-webconfig-security&quot;&gt;http://dotnet.dzone.com/articles/continuous-webconfig-security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s maybe too easy to think about Devops just in terms of devs and ops, and ignore all the other folks who are part of a well rounded product team. One group that often gets overlooked are the support folks, if any set of people can help bridge the communications gaps it&amp;rsquo;s good professional communicators. This post, from a former developer at Flickr, really gets that across &amp;ndash; in the form of a rant about why firing much of the support team is such a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nolancaudill.com/2012/01/30/the-front-line/&quot;&gt;http://nolancaudill.com/2012/01/30/the-front-line/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensu, the nice looking new monitoring framework, is picking up speed it seems. Describing Sensu as a &amp;ldquo;monitoring router&amp;rdquo; makes for a nice picture, this post covers integrating Sensu with Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joemiller.me/2012/02/02/sensu-and-graphite/&quot;&gt;http://joemiller.me/2012/02/02/sensu-and-graphite/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of NoOps cropped up again this week, and this post neatly summed up some of what I think, in particular it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;always Operations somewhere&amp;rdquo;. Operations is about running something and knowing how it works far more than it&amp;rsquo;s about specific tools and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraydon.co.uk/blog/2012/02/03/the-fallacy-of-noops/&quot;&gt;http://paulgraydon.co.uk/blog/2012/02/03/the-fallacy-of-noops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another follow up to the post about NoOps. This one really gets down to the problem with words and terminology. I think people really do want basically the same future, but trying to get into the debate with terms that actively exclude people is just poor marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spikelab.org/noops-good-idea-poor-wording-devops-paa/&quot;&gt;http://www.spikelab.org/noops-good-idea-poor-wording-devops-paa/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first devopsdays event is approaching, this one is being held in Austin, Texas on the 2nd and 3rd of April. They are still looking for sponsors and speakers so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested get in touch via the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-austin/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-austin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deltacloud appears to have been around for a while as it&amp;rsquo;s a full Apache project, but I only came across it yesterday in one of the talks at FOSDEM. It&amp;rsquo;s a Ruby web service that exposes a standard API for interacting with different cloud infrastructure providers like EC2, OpenStack and Rackspace. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple HTTP interface so you could just grab servers using curl, but the project also has a number of native client libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deltacloud.apache.org/&quot;&gt;http://deltacloud.apache.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new monitoring tool gathering some interest this week is Extremon. It appears early days (the code is just being made public on GitHub) but the aims and examples sound interesting. If anyone is at the #monitoringsucks hack day this week and gets a demo I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://extremon.org/?p=58&quot;&gt;https://extremon.org/?p=58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pas a certain number of projects the Jenkins dashboard can look quite busy. Jenkins features simple custom views but even this might not be enough on larger projects. Enter the View Job Filters plugins which provides a dizzying number of customisable options, some based both on the logged in user and the current state of various builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudbees.com/2012/01/controlling-what-you-see-with-view-job.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.cloudbees.com/2012/01/controlling-what-you-see-with-view-job.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 56 &amp;ndash; 29th January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little late shipped today I&amp;rsquo;m afraid and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll have missed some good content as I&amp;rsquo;ve been particularly busy this week. Next weekend I&amp;rsquo;ll be at FOSDEM, which either means a &amp;ldquo;live from Belgium&amp;rdquo; special edition, or another slight delay too. The good news though is with the configuration management and cloud dev rooms (and nice belgium beer) and I should find lots of good content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git is increasingly the source control tool of choice for many projects, and going from using it for person projects to using it in a team can be quite a jump, especially if coming from a simpler tool. This guide is quick, simple and features useful graphics to try get you over the hump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kentnguyen.com/development/visualized-git-practices-for-team/&quot;&gt;http://kentnguyen.com/development/visualized-git-practices-for-team/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudFoundry has a rather interesting new feature, namely the ability to span multiple cloud providers. Some details of how this works are covered in the announcement, along with some demos of it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/13481010615/multi-language-multi-framework-what-about-multi-cloud&quot;&gt;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/13481010615/multi-language-multi-framework-what-about-multi-cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning from others mistakes is nearly as good as learning from your own first hand, so this series looks interesting. Tales of database woe, first up issues with CHECKSUM and backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/database-administration/confessions-of-a-dba-my-worst-mistake/&quot;&gt;http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/database-administration/confessions-of-a-dba-my-worst-mistake/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m quite a Solr fan, so this article particularly interested me this week. Past a certain point index replication can become increasingly problematic, Etsy looked to solve this using BitTorrent as the distribution mechanism with some great results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/23/solr-bittorrent-index-replication/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/23/solr-bittorrent-index-replication/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s pursuit of speed is well known, this article covers some very low level TCP tweaks that might be useful to get that extra edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2012/01/lets-make-tcp-faster.html&quot;&gt;http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2012/01/lets-make-tcp-faster.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensu, the new monitoring framework, looked interesting when I first came across it. But this in-depth getting started article should make jumping in quickly possible. Lots of details of the commands needed to install and configure your first instance and writing your first check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joemiller.me/2012/01/19/getting-started-with-the-sensu-monitoring-framework/&quot;&gt;http://joemiller.me/2012/01/19/getting-started-with-the-sensu-monitoring-framework/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More examples of Jenkins being used for much more than continuous integration. The parallels between testing and monitoring have interested me for a while, and explains why Jenkins feature set makes using it as part of a monitoring setup easy. This post covers a simple check involving processes, databases and log files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/01/23/lowtech-monitoring-with-jenkins/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/01/23/lowtech-monitoring-with-jenkins/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some in the agile community continuous delivery, and especially continuous deployment, ring alarm bells. This well argued post covers why this might be, and places continuous delivery as a subset of more traditional agile practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kief.com/continuous_delivery/continuous_delivery_vs_agile.html&quot;&gt;http://kief.com/continuous_delivery/continuous_delivery_vs_agile.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub has grown large pretty quickly, and this talk covers some of the how. Refreshingly it focuses both on technical and people issues equally, and has worthwhile points on both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zachholman.com/talk/scaling-github&quot;&gt;http://zachholman.com/talk/scaling-github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of Chef should be looking forward to ChefConf, to be held May 15th-17th in San Francisco. A call for proposals is open too, until February 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chefconf.opscode.com/&quot;&gt;http://chefconf.opscode.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moncli looks like another interesting new take on the monitoring problem. Written in Python and based around a RabbitMQ message broker, it also features an interesting sounding compatibility layer for Nagios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smetj/Moncli&quot;&gt;https://github.com/smetj/Moncli&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 55 &amp;ndash; 22nd January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big welcome to all the new readers this week. In terms of subscriptions this last week has been just about the business since I started. Elsewhere I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing a definite increase in interest in this whole devops things. Hopefully that means even more interesting content to find and read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good thread on Reddit with members of the Mozilla web development team discussing the approach they have taken to deployment and testing. Covers a lot of continuous delivery ground, but with some interesting first hand experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/oonrg/iama_member_of_the_mozilla_webdev_team_ama/c3iufax&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/oonrg/iama_member_of_the_mozilla_webdev_team_ama/c3iufax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the configuration and systems management devroom at Fosdem are now up, and I&amp;rsquo;m already looking forward to lots of these talks. Talks covering new tools (Rudder), old tools (Jenkins) and some devops culture (DevOps is not an absolute. It&amp;rsquo;s a range.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/configuration_and_systems_management_devroom&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/configuration_and_systems_management_devroom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon launched a new part of their web services stack this week, with Amazon DynamoDB. They describe is as a fast and scalable NoSQL database service and it&amp;rsquo;s a fully managed service. The free tier should see people experimenting with this at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/01/amazon-dynamodb.html&quot;&gt;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/01/amazon-dynamodb.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting post about running Puppet without the master. It outlines concerns for certain setups with having a master and goes over how they dealt with things like stored configuration in a masterless setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://current.workingdirectory.net/posts/2011/puppet-without-masters/&quot;&gt;http://current.workingdirectory.net/posts/2011/puppet-without-masters/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well thought through post with a catchy title about how system administration is changing profoundly and rapidly. I particularly like this quote as I think it&amp;rsquo;s hopefully an increasingly common sentiment &amp;ldquo;But it’s finally dawned on me that “devops” isn’t just some buzzword concept that someone has thought up to make sysadmins’ lives hell. It’s the natural evolution of both professions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantasic presentation by Mike Brittain about the development of a performance culture at Etsy. It features just enough graphs to give you ideas and talks about the technical, business and people sides of how they made improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain/web-performance-culture-and-tools-at-etsy-11159635&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain/web-performance-culture-and-tools-at-etsy-11159635&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FreeAgent, online accounting pioneers helping freelancers and small businesses worldwide, are looking for a talented Operations Engineer to bridge the gap between product development and infrastructure and to scale their web app to handle hundreds of thousands of incredibly happy customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeagent.com/company/jobs/operations-engineer-devops&quot;&gt;http://www.freeagent.com/company/jobs/operations-engineer-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLOSS UK&amp;rsquo;s annual Large Installation Systems Administration (LISA) conference is coming up soon, in Edinburgh from the 20th to the 22nd March. They are still on the lookout for talks as well if you have any good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flossuk.org/Events/Spring2012&quot;&gt;http://www.flossuk.org/Events/Spring2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is gearing up for the big 1.0 release, with version 0.9 shipped this last week. Lots of things in this release, including support for bridged networks, huge windows improvements and support for multiple versions of virtual box. The Vagrantfile syntax has changed a little however, but on first run you should be told what you need to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vagrantup.com/docs/changes/changes_08x_09x.html&quot;&gt;http://vagrantup.com/docs/changes/changes_08x_09x.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very nice looking simple load testing tool. Rather than cover the same ground as everyone else it&amp;rsquo;s one real feature is a way to visualise the resulting concurrent request success and failure rate. Beautifully simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewvc/parbench&quot;&gt;https://github.com/andrewvc/parbench&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(R?)ex is a Perl based remote command execution engine. The site has lots of nice examples and clear documentation, from a quick look it feels a lot like Fabric in Python. Might be useful, in particular if you&amp;rsquo;re happier with Perl than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very glad the growing devops community seems largely to be made up of people with an open source ethic. Even more than usual over the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve found my time saved by finding a useful library on Github and in more than one case pull requests have been sent and speedily accepted. I just wanted to say thank you to anyone maintaining a useful library or application before getting on with the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service, is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been describing Jenkins as an automation framework as much as a continuous integration system. So it&amp;rsquo;s good to read about others having success doing the same. Some good examples and discussion of when this is a good idea and when it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://morgajel.net/2011/12/12/1108&quot;&gt;http://morgajel.net/2011/12/12/1108&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just out today so I&amp;rsquo;ve not had a chance to listen yet, here&amp;rsquo;s episode 1 of a new community podcast all about Chef. Good luck to the folks behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/01/episode-1-chef-in-2012.html&quot;&gt;http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/01/episode-1-chef-in-2012.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick fire series of articles focusing on the effect of latency on monitoring. It talks about why latency is a problem, how you might architect a system to avoid the problems and then onto a nicely worked example with lots of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/01/09/monitoring-sucks-latency-sucks-more/&quot;&gt;http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/01/09/monitoring-sucks-latency-sucks-more/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a few weeks to go until FOSDEM and some of the tracks have started publishing schedules. The configuration management devroom isn&amp;rsquo;t up yet, but the Development track has a devops flavoured talk and the virtualization and cloud devroom should be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/virtualization_and_cloud_devroom&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/virtualization_and_cloud_devroom&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ever tried to convince management that something is the way to do this post is worth reading. It&amp;rsquo;s both a description, and a note sent to Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s management about how Flickr achieved a good balance between speed and availability. In particular it stresses the importance that everyone owns availability, not just an operations team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/01/05/convincing-management-that-cooperation-and-collaboration-was-worth-it/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/01/05/convincing-management-that-cooperation-and-collaboration-was-worth-it/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;devops&amp;rdquo; might still be relatively new, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean lots of relevant research and writing doesn&amp;rsquo;t already exist. The collaboration aspect and wide scope of the domain can feel vague to some, Patrick here argues that&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s a so called wicked problem. Some great resources linked from this post in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/08/devops-a-wicked-problem/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/08/devops-a-wicked-problem/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post features a nice walk through the of main components in a large Java continuous delivery setup. Covers the virtualization platform, configuration management, load balancing, application server and deployment tools used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.xebia.com/2011/12/14/continuous-delivery-for-enterprise-java-applications/&quot;&gt;http://blog.xebia.com/2011/12/14/continuous-delivery-for-enterprise-java-applications/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automating DNS management is fun, and becoming increasingly easy with nice new DNS providers often publishing well designed web friendly APIs. This post features lots of examples using DNSimple, Ruby and Chef, but even if you&amp;rsquo;re using a different stack it&amp;rsquo;s still worth reading just for ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/01/02/switching-to-dnsimple/&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/01/02/switching-to-dnsimple/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of Puppercamp events coming up in the first half of this year. Dates for Atalanta, Edinburgh and Stockholm have already been announced and details of some of the sessions in Atlanta on the 3rd of February are already available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/atlantapuppetcamp/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/atlantapuppetcamp/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-camp/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-camp/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molog is another take on what to do with logs. It integrates heavily with logstash (for getting hold of logs) and nagios (for monitoring and altering). The command line tool for querying state looks useful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smetj.net/wiki/Molog_documentation&quot;&gt;http://www.smetj.net/wiki/Molog_documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself scraping the HTML from Nagios this last week to make a very quick dashboard. It&amp;rsquo;s not like it&amp;rsquo;s changed in the last 10 years so I reasoned it would be pretty stable. Then I came across Nagiosharder, a Ruby API build completely around a scraper, that exposes lots of the most common Nagios features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/railsmachine/nagiosharder&quot;&gt;https://github.com/railsmachine/nagiosharder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of both Git and code reviews, but at times some of the code review tools can feel quite heavy wight. So for me Reviewthis looks excellent. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple sinatra app you can run for free on Heroku and which lets you ask for reviews as part of commits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 53 &amp;ndash; 8th January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some big news this week for devopsweekly &amp;ndash; I now have a sponsor. All
that really means to you the reader is you&amp;rsquo;ll get a short sponsors
message at the top of each edition which I&amp;rsquo;m hoping you&amp;rsquo;ll find useful.
Say a huge thanks to the nice folks at Brightbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sponsor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightbox Cloud &amp;ndash; the UK&amp;rsquo;s only multi-zone cloud infrastructure service,
is the new sponsor of Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brightbox.com&quot;&gt;http://brightbox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely article about the tool building ecosystem at Etsy. The examples
given also look fantastic, I&amp;rsquo;m sure anyone using Solr in anger will be
thinking about how they can get something like the Etsy query analyser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/04/the-product-hacking-ecosystem/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/04/the-product-hacking-ecosystem/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another fantastic article about how Netflix organise their teams of
developers and operations folks. Some great take aways from the notes,
including negative opinions about &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo; teams and some ideas
about structuring multiple teams in an engineering organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-netflix-gets-out-of-way-of.html&quot;&gt;http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-netflix-gets-out-of-way-of.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts about what one user would like to see in the Chef
ecosystem this year. Some discussions well worth having, including
packaging cookbooks, driving wider Ruby support and the best ways to
test of cookbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/01/chef-in-2012.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/01/chef-in-2012.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An argument against a mad dash towards using the latest tools and a call
for more writing and discussion about the processes and techniques used
by different organisations. I&amp;rsquo;d definitely agree from the point of view
of compiling this newsletter it&amp;rsquo;s easier to find content focused only on
tooling, the Etsy and Netflix posts above being great exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/we-have-the-tools-but-what-about-the-techniques/&quot;&gt;http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/we-have-the-tools-but-what-about-the-techniques/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good writeup of various monitoring tools and ways in which you might
integrate them. Covers getting data in and out of lots of tools
including graphite, ganglia, cumin, cacti and more. A separate post goes
into more detail about Nagios &amp;ldquo;Controlling the tool everybody hates, but
still uses&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-metrics-api-gateways/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-metrics-api-gateways/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-nagios-the-mighty-beast/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-nagios-the-mighty-beast/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editors Note: I nearly didn&amp;rsquo;t include this next post because someone is
going to suggest it&amp;rsquo;s only here because of the sponsorship. It&amp;rsquo;s the
opposite. One of the reasons I agreed to have Brightbox sponsor was that
they build interesting tools and write about them online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the Riak handbook over the holidays I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to
set up a cluster to play with, and this article covers how to do so
pretty simply. The instructions are for Brightbox cloud but you can
easily extract the Riak specific commands if you&amp;rsquo;re hosted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.brightbox.com/guides/cli/riak-cluster/&quot;&gt;http://docs.brightbox.com/guides/cli/riak-cluster/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After FOSDEM, on the 6th and 7th of February, a few people are gathering
under the #monitoringsucks umbrella for a hack day. If you can get to
Antwerp then it should be an interesting few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/monitoringsucks-and-well-fix-it&quot;&gt;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/monitoringsucks-and-well-fix-it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Rackspace have open sourced Dreadnot, an in-house tool for
continuous deployment. It looks to be doing some interesting things with
regards multi-region deployments and the discussion of their experiences
with Etsy&amp;rsquo;s deployinator are worth reading too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/blog/2012/01/05/rackspace-open-sources-dreadnot/&quot;&gt;http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/blog/2012/01/05/rackspace-open-sources-dreadnot/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/racker/dreadnot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/racker/dreadnot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting looking project to collect common utility scripts for
Jenkins. At the moment it contains only a few groovy scripts for the
script console for purging old data, but the idea is it should contain
all sorts of useful code to help manage jenkins. I&amp;rsquo;d encourage anyone
with scripts they already use to think about sending a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-scripts&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foodcritica is a nice looking lint tool for your Opscode Chef cookbooks.
It covers 18 rules so far from some LWRP checks to checking for the
correct metadata. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be integrated with a continuous
integration system as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/&quot;&gt;http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty comprehensive looking Puppet module for managing the
installation and configuration of a Jenkins instance. It covers the
installation of Jenkins plugins as well which is particularly handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unethicalblogger.com/2011/12/28/jenkins-with-puppet.html&quot;&gt;http://unethicalblogger.com/2011/12/28/jenkins-with-puppet.html&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 52 &amp;ndash; 1st January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A happy new year to everyone, here&amp;rsquo;s hoping 2012 will be just as productive on the devops front as 2011. The advantage of not sending anything last week is that this issue is overflowing with interesting content. It looks like at least a few folks have taken the time away from work to hack or write so thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extensive series of blog posts about implementing a continuous deployment setup in a .NET environment. Lots of screenshots. Lots of code examples. Lots of discussion about the tools used and what worked and what didn&amp;rsquo;t. Worth reading whether you&amp;rsquo;re using ASP.NET or not as most of it is application to any setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli&quot;&gt;http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s_Continuous_Delivery_Project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing the importance of cross functional teams can be difficult, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to push back on or water down. This post on the Continuous Delivery blog says to organize software delivery around outcomes, not roles. It&amp;rsquo;s a good read and probably a good article to pass on to management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://continuousdelivery.com/2011/12/organize-software-delivery-around-outcomes-not-roles/&quot;&gt;http://continuousdelivery.com/2011/12/organize-software-delivery-around-outcomes-not-roles/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opscode Community Summit looked like excellent fun (so it&amp;rsquo;s good to hear that it was the first of many). 40 sessions over 2 days generated lots of discussion, and nicely lots of those sessions have been written up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+Community+Summit+1&quot;&gt;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+Community+Summit+1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuring MySQL can be something of a black art. This excellent questionnaire based online application from Percona aims to make anyone with a web browser able to generate a sensible configuration for their particular setup. Very slick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.percona.com/&quot;&gt;http://tools.percona.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered which EC2 region to use for a particular geographical area? Well this open source project is doing interesting things to try and find out based on proximity and bandwidth availability. Interesting visualisations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/aws-datacenters&quot;&gt;http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/aws-datacenters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next release of Jenkins (1.446) has a very interesting looking feature slated for inclusion, namely exposing parts of the command line interface over a randomly assigned SSH interface. This should make it easier to automate Jenkins without carrying around the Java based command line interface library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+SSH&quot;&gt;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+SSH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest release of Graylog2, the excellent log management tool, has made a big change to it&amp;rsquo;s architecture and added a number of interesting looking features. Messages are now stored in ElasticSearch, allowing for faster queries against very large datasets. Aggregate statistics are stored elsewhere allowing for much faster graph generation and much longer term analytics. And the new browser based query shell looks good too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://graylog2.org/ohai/0.9.6&quot;&gt;http://graylog2.org/ohai/0.9.6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holidays might be nearly over but everyone always has time for more reading. Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of books, articles and papers to get you started in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/22/holiday-reading-list.html&quot;&gt;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/22/holiday-reading-list.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heals of the excellent puppet extensions series comes the start of a series on Puppet internals. This first part covers the Puppet Parser in quite some detail. Lots of code, good diagrams. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in working on Puppet itself or just seeing the insides of an interesting piece of software this is worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/12/27/puppet-internals-the-parser/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/12/27/puppet-internals-the-parser/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualision is always fun and potentially incredibly useful. This excellent blog post looks at an approach to visualising load across a large number of devices in such a way as to allow people to spot patterns. The break down of the problem and then working up the solution is excellent, and the end results very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2011/12/18/visualizing-device-utilization/&quot;&gt;http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2011/12/18/visualizing-device-utilization/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logs are an important part of knowing what is going on with our applications. This article argues that the sheer volume of lots means that log formats optimised for people are flawed, and more structured data optimised for machines is the better approach &amp;ndash; specifically that JSON is perfect. Lots of examples, code and a well worked argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2011/12/26/log-for-machines-in-json/&quot;&gt;http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2011/12/26/log-for-machines-in-json/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FnordMetric describes itself as a realtime app/event tracking thing based on ruby eventmachine and redis. The screenshots look great and give you an idea of what&amp;rsquo;s possible, and the documentation is extensive and includes lots of code samples. The todo list is also nothing if not ambitious, hopefully one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered which of your puppet resources was taking all that time? This very handy utility will give you a list of the slowest performing resources allowing you to optimise where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-profiler&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-profiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick shell script to build native packages (using fpm) of a list of gems. Specifically designed for use as a Jenkins jobs to automatically build the package when new ones are added. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to see how they are (automatically?) published to the yum repository mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrisBuytaert/build-gems&quot;&gt;https://github.com/KrisBuytaert/build-gems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite has lots of fans, but it seems not everyone is smitten with the web interface. Graphiti is a Ruby, Javascript and Redis based application that provides an alternative dashboard with some nice features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paperlesspost/graphiti&quot;&gt;https://github.com/paperlesspost/graphiti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a love/hate relationship with Nagios, and anything that makes automation easier has to be a good thing. This project provides a Ruby API client for the Livestatus Nagios plugin. It could do with more worked examples and better documentation but it looks an interesting and powerful approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zenops/livestatus&quot;&gt;https://github.com/zenops/livestatus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heals of releasing the Hubot Campfire bot the folks at GitHub have released the tools they use to control a Jenkins continuous integration server via the same bot. It&amp;rsquo;s designed for easy installation to Heroku so quick to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 51 &amp;ndash; 18th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the bad news, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take next weekend off so the next issue won&amp;rsquo;t be for two whole weeks. The good news is I have a bumper Christmas edition this week, which should hopefully keep everyone going until the new year. I&amp;rsquo;ve not been keeping track but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this is the most content I&amp;rsquo;ve included so far, and hopefully their will be something for everyone. Thanks again to all the authors of articles, covers of talks and hackers of code that make devopsweekly good fun to put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone interested or already using Riak should buy themselves an early Christmas present. Mathias Meyer has been writing furiously and has just shipped the self published Riak Handbook. It&amp;rsquo;s available as a bundle of Epub, Mobi and PDF. Importantly it covers not just using Riak, but also running it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://riakhandbook.com/&quot;&gt;http://riakhandbook.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the articles I include tend to be about learning new interesting things. This one is more of a warning &amp;ndash; at some point soon the Sun Java packages are going to disappear from the Ubuntu partner repositories due to Oracle licensing changes. If someone finds a good article about the best thing to do if this affects you let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html&quot;&gt;https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good article with a few opinions about the state of log management. Mentioned logstash and graylog2. Interesting points about the initial fear of new moving parts and complexity being mitigated by the usefulness of the resulting setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redbluemagenta.com/2011/08/19/modern-log-management-and-monitoring/&quot;&gt;http://redbluemagenta.com/2011/08/19/modern-log-management-and-monitoring/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of talk, and writing, about testing configuration management this week.  Nikolay Sturm, author of Cucumber-puppet, has created an example project demonstrating that tools usage. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to follow and makes a good template if you&amp;rsquo;re starting to write features for your manifests and modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nistu.de/2011/12/11/an-example-project-using-cucumber-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://blog.nistu.de/2011/12/11/an-example-project-using-cucumber-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nistude/cucumber-puppet.example&quot;&gt;https://github.com/nistude/cucumber-puppet.example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabric is great for ad-hoc remote command execution, but that means it doesn&amp;rsquo;t ship with higher level abstractions that make common tasks just a matter of configuration. The discussion in this issue sounds interesting, a canonical source for useful snippets and higher level commands is in the works. For the moment the list of existing supporting tools is worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/461&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/461&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third article in a good series of posts about extending Puppet. This one particularly caught the eye as it covers what the Indirector is. If you&amp;rsquo;ve delved into Puppet source recently then you&amp;rsquo;ll have come across this and if you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me taken a bit of time to get your head around. This post solves that problem for future visitors to the Puppet code very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/12/11/the-indirector-puppet-extensions-points-3/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/12/11/the-indirector-puppet-extensions-points-3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good talk from Luke Kaines (creator of Puppet) at LISA. Starting with a good list of what Devops isn&amp;rsquo;t and then going on to the rapid changes in web operations. Also breaks down the agile manifesto in terms of systems administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxBEEh4Nsnk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxBEEh4Nsnk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another talk from LISA, this time from Jesse Robins of Opscode explaining the concept of a Gameday. I particularly love the quote &amp;ldquo;failure free operations require experience with failure&amp;rdquo;. Lots of other good takeaways in the slides too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jesserobbins/ameday-creating-resiliency-through-destruction&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jesserobbins/ameday-creating-resiliency-through-destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big conferences certainly make my life easier when looking for great content :) The last of this weeks LISA talks, this one the keynote given by Ben Rockwood. A pretty high level and convincing argument for Devops, painting it as a journey of discovery and not the final destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.usenix.org/2011/12/08/lisa-11-keynote-the-devops-transformation/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.usenix.org/2011/12/08/lisa-11-keynote-the-devops-transformation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice slide deck summarising Infrastructure as Code. Particular good for the diagrams used to explain the different parts of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/guttertec/infrastructure-as-code-10499271&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/guttertec/infrastructure-as-code-10499271&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent hashing is magic. This article explains how it works and why you should care. If you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with improving the availability of data intensive applications then this is a must read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/9/the-magic-of-consistent-hashing.html&quot;&gt;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/9/the-magic-of-consistent-hashing.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sysadvent has kept up the high quality posts, this one particularly caught my eye. Everyone has logs that they&amp;rsquo;d love to analyse, this post shows how to do so relatively simply using Elastic Map Reduce (Hadoop on EC2) and the Pig query language. Good getting started post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Patrick Debois Show&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone obviously put something in the water in Gent over the last week or so, as Patrick started churning out new and interesting content on a nearly daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post reprints an article written for the Usenix Login magazine, entitled Devops from a sysadmin perspective. It takes the familiar topics of culture, automation, measurement and sharing and breaks things down purely from the perspective of the working systems administrator. A good read if you&amp;rsquo;re skeptical and thinking devops is a bunch of developers trying to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/07/devops-from-a-sysadmin-perspective/&quot;&gt;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/07/devops-from-a-sysadmin-perspective/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier the topic of testing configuration management came up a few times this week, and this post is one of the very few around on the topic. It covers using Cucumber-puppet, Rspec-puppet and puppet-lint to introduce some useful tests to your puppet code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/05/puppet-unit-testing-like-a-pro/&quot;&gt;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/05/puppet-unit-testing-like-a-pro/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of how the above tools might work in a real project, this github repo sets up vagrant and guard (a ruby library using inotify) to automatically run your puppet manifests against a virtual machine as you edit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jedi4ever/vagrant-guard-demo&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jedi4ever/vagrant-guard-demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another little trick, this time for writing cucumber steps that can be more easily run across different systems using a couple of environment variables. The features are also worth having a look at if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in using cucumber and the aruba provided steps for testing command output and exit codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/15/bdd-testing-with-vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/15/bdd-testing-with-vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1476703&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/1476703&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rack-statsd is a number of pieces of Rack middleware for monitoring Ruby applications. Contains three middleware components extracted from GitHub for adding a health check URL, adding hostnames and git hashes as headers and sending unicorn process information to statsd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/rack-statsd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/github/rack-statsd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building system packages can mean having access to lots of different architectures. Local virtual machines can help here, and this project shows a nice way forward. It provides a vagrant setup and puppet modules to both install build dependencies and to compile and build rpm packages on the resulting virtual machine. Nice idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/roidelapluie/vagrant-build-mapnik&quot;&gt;https://github.com/roidelapluie/vagrant-build-mapnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 50 - 11th December 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/12/11/issue-50/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 50 &amp;ndash; 11th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week was a little short, mainly because I&amp;rsquo;d been pretty busy of late. This week I spent a bit more time looking and reading, so hopefully this issue should keep everyone busy until next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of message based systems and this article is an excellent starting point if you&amp;rsquo;re not that familiar with some of the terminology and general patterns. It covers what, why and some simple how examples. CoilMQ mentioned in the post also looks excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/12/11/common-messaging-patterns-using-stomp.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/12/11/common-messaging-patterns-using-stomp.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re the kind of person who prefers videos to long introductions, this presentation also covers message based architecture. It focuses a little on doing so with Sprint and discusses AMQP rather than stomp but it&amp;rsquo;s still makes a good introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Messaging-for-Modern-Applications&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Messaging-for-Modern-Applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next post asserts that &amp;ldquo;Devops has made Release and Deployment Cool&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d argue that it&amp;rsquo;s always been cool but that might just have been me :) The devops banner has certainly raised the awareness and level of debate between different parties about release automation. The brief discussion about the good and bad points about vendor involvement are also well put.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/12/devops-has-made-release-and-deployment.html&quot;&gt;http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/12/devops-has-made-release-and-deployment.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flume project, for collecting and aggregating log files, is looking at re-architecting how it works based on real world usage. Flume NG is the working title and this post discusses the upcoming plans for change. Interesting if you&amp;rsquo;re using Flume or if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reliable distributed systems design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.apache.org/flume/entry/flume_ng_architecture&quot;&gt;https://blogs.apache.org/flume/entry/flume_ng_architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of experiences from other sectors and approaches can be brought to bear on devops related problems. This post covers various Lean Manufacturing examples and in particular value stream mapping and applies them to web operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/12/5/companies-have-plenty-of-monitoring-what-they-dont-have-is-c.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/12/5/companies-have-plenty-of-monitoring-what-they-dont-have-is-c.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting log data in a manner that makes it easy to analyse can be tricky. This article covers using Fluentd to take apache logs and push them into a mongodb database with a minimum of configuration. Fluentd supports lots of different backends too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.treasure-data.com/post/13766262632/real-time-log-collection-with-fluentd-and-mongodb&quot;&gt;http://blog.treasure-data.com/post/13766262632/real-time-log-collection-with-fluentd-and-mongodb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent detailed post on the difference between Puppet&amp;rsquo;s parameterized classes and definitions. Done via relatively straightforward examples showing the differences and when to use both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigdunn.org/2011/09/puppet-parameterized-classes-vs-definitions/&quot;&gt;http://www.craigdunn.org/2011/09/puppet-parameterized-classes-vs-definitions/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice interview from Goto Conference with the authors of Continuous Delivery. It covers various strategies and patterns for testing, building and releasing software, and how these fit in with agile and lean software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devnology.nl/en/podcast/10-content/181-devnology-podcast-023-continuous-delivery&quot;&gt;http://devnology.nl/en/podcast/10-content/181-devnology-podcast-023-continuous-delivery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice infrastructure as code presentation introducing Chef for both managing server software and then going onto using Chef for deployment. Another presentation from GOTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Chef-in-the-Cloud-and-On-the-Ground&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Chef-in-the-Cloud-and-On-the-Ground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love what Puppet is doing and want to be a part of it? Puppet Labs, creators of Puppet, is growing, and are currently hiring for Professional Services Engineer (OR, NYC, UK), Operations Engineer (OR), Technical Training Manager (OR) and Account Manager (OR). Interested or know someone who might be? Check out our job postings (and apply online)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/jobs&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Librarian is a tool to resolve recursively a set of specifications and fetch and install the fully resolved specifications, in particular it provides a way of a managing a repository of Chef cookbooks. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with something like bundler in ruby or the requirements.txt file from pip in python then it&amp;rsquo;s something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian&quot;&gt;https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foodcritic looks like an excellent lint tool for Chef cookbooks. It only has a small number of (useful) checks at present but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to add more if you have a particular pattern you want to enforce or quash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic&quot;&gt;https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/&quot;&gt;http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the dependency on Node.js put you off the GitHub Hubot campfire bot, then this might be exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re after. This &amp;lsquo;fork&amp;rsquo; is written entirely in bash, with plugins being any arbitrary executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/teddziuba/hubot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/teddziuba/hubot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of organisations running large server clusters seem to be using or experimenting with bittorrent for distribution of code deploys. This project from Hyves is interesting mainly because of the details around making sure nodes in a given rack don&amp;rsquo;t all swamp the available uplink bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hyves-org/p2ptracker&quot;&gt;https://github.com/hyves-org/p2ptracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 49 &amp;ndash; 4th December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s December again which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for Sysadvent. Curated by Jordan Sissel, this advent calendar style blog brings a new post every day from a range of guest authors. Hats off to Jordan on this, at least with the newsletter I only have to put things together once a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned Sysadvent is back, with four blog posts for far, and one per day throughout December. So far we&amp;rsquo;ve had bash tips, java deployment ideas, simple examples of web tools for letting other people run code and an introduction to packaging systems. All well worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-1-dont-bash-your-process-outputs.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-1-dont-bash-your-process-outputs.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-2-strategies-for-java-deployment.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-2-strategies-for-java-deployment.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-3-share-skills-and-permissions-with.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-3-share-skills-and-permissions-with.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-4-guide-to-packaging-systems.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-4-guide-to-packaging-systems.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-ups of an organisations entire stack are always interesting, this one is from Instagram who have quite the fleet of instances on EC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of&quot;&gt;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has tried to setup a continuous integration system to test across a range of different browsers already knows it&amp;rsquo;s not the easiest thing to maintain. If you&amp;rsquo;re now running on Windows already then you probably need some Windows machines too. This article covers doing just that in EC2, and features code to both start instances and run the tests on the windows hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.picklive.com/2011/12/02/continuous-integration-for-internet-explorer.html&quot;&gt;http://tech.picklive.com/2011/12/02/continuous-integration-for-internet-explorer.html&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a bit of time tweaking Varnish configurations this week and came across this article, which is worth reading mainly for the example vcl configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lullabot.com/articles/varnish-multiple-web-servers-drupal&quot;&gt;http://www.lullabot.com/articles/varnish-multiple-web-servers-drupal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting post positing that &amp;ldquo;Devops is the missing link between Agile/Extreme Programming and lean management&amp;rdquo;, coming from a large company Chief Information Officer it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how the idea is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://informationsystemsbiology.blogspot.com/2011/11/lean-it-devops-and-cloud-programming.html&quot;&gt;http://informationsystemsbiology.blogspot.com/2011/11/lean-it-devops-and-cloud-programming.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a number of Python or Django applications, or you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how a platform as a service operates under the hood, you might want to take a look at Djangy which has recently been open sourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dpaola2/djangy&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dpaola2/djangy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequencer is &amp;ldquo;an engine used by system administrators for the computation and execution of sequences of actions over hardware or software&amp;rdquo;. The examples make things a little clearer, if you&amp;rsquo;re running a physical data centre and need to software to power on/off computers, disk arrays, switches ad the like this might be of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pv-bull.github.com/sequencer/&quot;&gt;http://pv-bull.github.com/sequencer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a thing for yet more process supervision tools, Nanny might be of interest. It&amp;rsquo;s been developed by the folks behind Freebase and looks to have a few nice features including an In-built HTTP server for logs and statistics with both humanly-readable and machine-readable JSON output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/metaweb-nanny/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/metaweb-nanny/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 48 &amp;ndash; 27th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first issue of this newsletter went out just about 1 year ago this weekend to 476 people. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I started that if I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be sending one a year later to over 2000 folks, so thanks to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s stuck around or signed up since. With that in mind I&amp;rsquo;ve finally updated the archive to include all the recent issues too &lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsweekly.com/archive&quot;&gt;http://devopsweekly.com/archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration management devroom at FOSDEM in Belgium is back for a second year, and the call for papers is open. You have until the 31st of December to get proposals in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.puppetlabs.com/&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.puppetlabs.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short interview with Ben Rockwood, who&amp;rsquo;s going to be talking at LISA’11 next month on The Devops Transformation. Quick answers to questions, but it&amp;rsquo;s good to see in a traditional systems administration setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.usenix.org/2011/11/15/ben-rockwood-interview/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.usenix.org/2011/11/15/ben-rockwood-interview/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are talking about what monitoring could look like in the future, and this great diagram tries to map out the different components involved and some of the existing software used for the job. Very useful if you&amp;rsquo;re starting to think about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/vj83geq6aiyzt5q/monitoring-puzzle.png&quot;&gt;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/vj83geq6aiyzt5q/monitoring-puzzle.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant now has a public continuous integration server, which bodes well for future stability. As a fast moving project dependent on a third party piece of software in VirtualBox this is particularly important in avoiding version mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ci.vagrantup.com/&quot;&gt;http://ci.vagrantup.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent looking list for anyone in a hurry to lock down a PHP application server. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty extensive and at least tries to explain the why as well as giving you the commands to run. Some of the comments add a few more ideas as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/php-security-best-practices-tutorial.html&quot;&gt;http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/php-security-best-practices-tutorial.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice presentation from Patrick Debois about taking learnings from the management of production infrastructure and applying that back to managing development environments and test machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/manage-your-devtestprod-like-a-cloud&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/manage-your-devtestprod-like-a-cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting post describing using Hubot (the GitHub campfire bot) for triggering deployments. Interestingly thought this is in a .NET and Teamcity context. Some good ideas and sample code for extending hubot as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomb.io/posts/hubot-ci-and-deploying/&quot;&gt;http://tomb.io/posts/hubot-ci-and-deploying/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video from the recent London Puppet user group meetup, with Ken Barber talking on Puppet, Private Clouds and Building Solutions. It looks to be a pretty nice demo of OpenNebula as well as some Puppet tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/32197839&quot;&gt;http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/32197839&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CitCon, the Continuous Integration conference took place a few weeks back, and this post summarises a few of the talking points. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in someone writing up the discussions around feature branching too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jr0cket.blogspot.com/2011/11/7-continuous-integration-ideas-from.html&quot;&gt;http://jr0cket.blogspot.com/2011/11/7-continuous-integration-ideas-from.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly didn&amp;rsquo;t include this next post, because it&amp;rsquo;s a Chef vs Puppet one. However it&amp;rsquo;s relatively balanced and stresses the answer to which to use is probably &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. The interesting quote that swung it for me was &amp;ldquo;I often wonder if Chef is the right tool because it&amp;rsquo;s the second one we&amp;rsquo;ve used&amp;rdquo;. I definitely agree with this, leaning a tool (Chef or Puppet) and a pattern like configuration management at the same time is a big ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nathenharvey.blogspot.com/2011/11/why-we-chose-puppet-over-chef-at.html&quot;&gt;http://nathenharvey.blogspot.com/2011/11/why-we-chose-puppet-over-chef-at.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cases where you want to use Chef without the server component, Pocketknife looks interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s a set of configuration conventions and a nice command line interface for syncing and running chef-solo on a remote machine. Personally I like this sort of thing for local virtual machines or short lived instances used for development. You should probably be using the server if you&amp;rsquo;re managing production machines in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/igal/pocketknife&quot;&gt;https://github.com/igal/pocketknife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to get the stream of Nagios events onto a message queue this project might be worth a look. It consists of two components that, when combined, use Nagios Event Broker to gather data and output the messages using STOMP to Activemq. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in seeing things built atop that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/neb2activemq/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/neb2activemq/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KermIT appears to be an open source web application frontend to a Puppet master and Mcollective. Limited documentation at the moment but the videos looks very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kermit.fr/&quot;&gt;http://www.kermit.fr/&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 47 &amp;ndash; 20th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully a good mix of content this week; new tools, existing tools, culture change, new services and some excellent presentations. Oh and a very exciting job for someone. Let me know what you&amp;rsquo;d like to see more (or less) of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both a big fan of Jenkins and a frequent Ruby developer I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about the newly released ability to write Jenkins plugins in Ruby. Although only some parts of the API are natively available using JRuby means you can just delve into the Java if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jenkins-ci.org/content/beginning-new-era-ruby-plugins-now-reality&quot;&gt;http://jenkins-ci.org/content/beginning-new-era-ruby-plugins-now-reality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post suggests past some things developers and operations can agree on is a large gap which needs more discussion, namely standardisation. Mature automation probably means limiting what&amp;rsquo;s being automated, and getting the conversation going about what is in a corporate wide supported platform should be done sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://saviorodrigues.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/no-devops-without-standardization-2/&quot;&gt;http://saviorodrigues.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/no-devops-without-standardization-2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Percona Live MySQL conference held in London earlier in the year have released all the slides to the two days of talks. Lots of interesting looking material if you&amp;rsquo;re using or interested in MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/slides/&quot;&gt;http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/slides/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article on another area of misaligned incentives, cutting operations teams because everything is running smoothly. I liked the statement &amp;ldquo;there is no easy way to prove your worth when it’s only apparent when things go wrong&amp;rdquo; and the fact the article points out this isn&amp;rsquo;t something you can easily fight against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.real-user-monitoring.com/when-it-ops-is-a-victim-of-its-own-competence/&quot;&gt;http://www.real-user-monitoring.com/when-it-ops-is-a-victim-of-its-own-competence/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned Pennyworth last week in the tools section, it&amp;rsquo;s a Jenkins based continuous deployment system which makes extensive use of Chef under the hood. This blog post acts as a quick start tutorial and should make getting started easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://junglist.gen.nz/blog/2011/11/16/pennyworth-quick-start/&quot;&gt;http://junglist.gen.nz/blog/2011/11/16/pennyworth-quick-start/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only in beta at the moment but Boundary looks to be another thing that can be purchased as a service, this time it&amp;rsquo;s Network monitoring. Chef and Puppet code and support for Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows7, and MacOS X out of the gate too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://boundary.com/&quot;&gt;https://boundary.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent looking presentation on building usable command line interfaces. The later examples provide lots of good tips for people writing in Ruby, but much of the rest is relevant to everyone. Well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awesome-cli-ruby.heroku.com/#1&quot;&gt;http://awesome-cli-ruby.heroku.com/#1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real world stories of failure are always informative and useful, and this article with examples of monitoring lying to you are fantastic. It&amp;rsquo;s a good list that anyone can go back and look at their monitoring with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/11/15/why-your-monitoring-is-lying-to-you/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/11/15/why-your-monitoring-is-lying-to-you/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripe is building next-generation infrastructure for online payments, and we&amp;rsquo;re expanding our devops team. If you love building highly scalable, chaos monkey-proof systems; if automating tasks is muscle memory; and if taking updates is a cathartic experience, then you should do-release-upgrade to Stripe. To apply, send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x61;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#58;&amp;#x6a;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#98;&amp;#115;&amp;#64;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x70;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#106;&amp;#111;&amp;#98;&amp;#x73;&amp;#64;&amp;#115;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x69;&amp;#112;&amp;#101;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt; with your Github and Twitter usernames and a rant about an infrastructure tool of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulse is the log stream parsing engine used by Heroku for real time monitoring of their platform. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to see how this fits into anyone else&amp;rsquo;s architecture as it looks very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/heroku/pulse&quot;&gt;https://github.com/heroku/pulse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend an awful lot of time using a terminal, but until now one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve generally used other tools for is quick visualisations. Enter Spark, a command line spark lines script. The quick examples, showing git commit patterns and data from a url using common command line tools are great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/holman/spark&quot;&gt;https://github.com/holman/spark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt looks like an interesting new entry to the remote execution game. It&amp;rsquo;s Python based and using 0MQ under the hood. Lots of documentation and lots of supported platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://saltstack.org/&quot;&gt;http://saltstack.org/&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 46 &amp;ndash; 13th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wish I had enough time to delve into all the content I feature
in these weekly emails. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s the same for many readers, so many
interesting goings on and too little time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of devops flavoured conversations talk about automation and tools,
but without really defining either. This post does just that and it&amp;rsquo;s
definitions should probably be adopted here on in. The points raised
about how automation can clash with existing uses of tools is nicely put
as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/11/tools-vs-automation.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/11/tools-vs-automation.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not always a fan of Capistrano, but past the defaults it&amp;rsquo;s
surprisingly flexible. This post covers some of those features,
including using several of the supported environment variables to manage
which hosts get tasks run on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.railsware.com/2011/11/02/advanced-server-definitions-in-capistrano/&quot;&gt;http://blog.railsware.com/2011/11/02/advanced-server-definitions-in-capistrano/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us not able to get to Velocity Europe this last week can at
least relive some of the experience by watching the videos of some of
the sessions, already uploaded to YouTube. 15 good lucking videos
available so far covering quite a range of interesting topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PLEF30FFC877957631&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PLEF30FFC877957631&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea in the monitoring space, monitoring.txt aims to be
for monitoring what robots.txt is for web crawlers. Currently it&amp;rsquo;s
related to a soon to be released commercial monitoring tool but in
theory it could be used by any monitoring framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://monitorstxt.org/&quot;&gt;http://monitorstxt.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet come up with a way of using Puppet environments that I
like, but many interesting conversations at Puppetconf were had on the
subject. This article shows a few tricks for using dynamic environments
based on git branches. The post commit hook example is particularly
useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/git-workflow-and-puppet-environments/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/git-workflow-and-puppet-environments/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain circles, conversation often turns to writing tests for
configuration management code. And hopefully the day is fast approaching
where this will be just how we do things. This blog post helps,
explaining why this is a good idea if you&amp;rsquo;re not already test infected,
and then showing how to test a puppet module with spec-puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bombasticmonkey.com/2011/11/04/test-your-puppet-modules-functions/&quot;&gt;http://bombasticmonkey.com/2011/11/04/test-your-puppet-modules-functions/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second article from Tim Sharpe, this one a nice Puppet story, with the
ending being that &amp;ldquo;anything is possible in Puppet if you’re willing to
get your hands dirty&amp;rdquo;. Puppet might provide a quite specific DSL, but if
you&amp;rsquo;re happy with Ruby you can take things much further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bombasticmonkey.com/2011/11/13/autonotify-resources-from-your-puppet-types/&quot;&gt;http://bombasticmonkey.com/2011/11/13/autonotify-resources-from-your-puppet-types/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah is the lightweight node/service registry from John Vincent,
inspired by Apache Zookeeper. John has a number of fairly large changes
he&amp;rsquo;s considering to make Noah more flexible and he&amp;rsquo;s looking for
feedback on some of the proposals. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re an existing user or
just interested worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lusis/Noah/wiki/Possible-changes-in-Noah&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lusis/Noah/wiki/Possible-changes-in-Noah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graylog2 is about to see a 0.9.6 release with some pretty large changes.
In particular log messages will no longer be stored in MongoDB,
requiring an ElasticSearch backend. This apparently resolves issues some
folks have had accessing large amounts of logs previously. Some changes
to graph rendering should also speed things up too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lennartkoopmann.net/post/12512504316/whats-coming-graylog2-v096&quot;&gt;http://www.lennartkoopmann.net/post/12512504316/whats-coming-graylog2-v096&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ScaleConf is a new 2 day conference being held in Cape Town in January
next year. They are currently looking for speakers and sponsors so if
you&amp;rsquo;re interested get in touch with the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scaleconf.org/&quot;&gt;http://scaleconf.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioned at work this week, this Ruby gem is a code coverage tool for
CSS. It&amp;rsquo;s aim is to find rules which are not longer used, letting you
delete them. This is good both from a performance point of view as well
as a maintenance one, less code is nearly always more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aanand/deadweight&quot;&gt;https://github.com/aanand/deadweight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pennyworth describes itself as &amp;ldquo;a continuous packaging system built
around Opscode&amp;rsquo;s Chef, Jenkins and the fpm packaging tool&amp;rdquo;. It ships
with vagrant support for testing, a wide range of Chef cookbooks and
some interesting looking data bag driven configuration. Would love to
see a walk through or detailed tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/11/06/issue-45/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 45 &amp;ndash; 6th November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With having just hit 2000 subscribers to this newsletter I thought I&amp;rsquo;d
take a moment to say a huge thank you to everyone who has written a blog
post, posted slides or video from a talk or built a tool I&amp;rsquo;ve featured
over the last 45 issues. This would be a much less interesting email and
importantly a much less vibrant community without the culture of
sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is great for quickly managing local virtual machines for
development, but if you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to even more accurately simulate the
network from a production cluster you have to delve into how VirtualBox
does its thing. This post does just that with details of VLAN, PXE boot
and bridged network support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2011/11/04/vagrant-virtualbox-hostonly-pxe-vlans/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2011/11/04/vagrant-virtualbox-hostonly-pxe-vlans/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice example of a shared puppet module for Cloudera&amp;rsquo;s Hadoop
distribution. Mainly picking out as I like the provided Vagrant
configuration which lets you play around with a three machine cluster
quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thattommyhall/cloudera-cdh3-puppet&quot;&gt;https://github.com/thattommyhall/cloudera-cdh3-puppet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is an often used term, and this article takes that and
describes it in terms of infrastructure. It&amp;rsquo;s a good take on the need to
automate where possible and raises good points about some of the people
and process things that need to be changed to make it happen. I
particularly liked the point that &amp;ldquo;people terribly underestimate the
amount of manual work they do to accomplish a task&amp;rdquo; which rings true in
my experience too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2011/11/03/infrastructure-debt/&quot;&gt;http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2011/11/03/infrastructure-debt/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as devops is about changes to processes and culture, lots of it
is also driven by people with a deep interest in tooling. And not only
are people writing tools or automating things, they are releasing them
at an ever increasing rate. This post tries to get across why it&amp;rsquo;s
nearly always worth it to clean up that code and throw it into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kartar.net/2011/11/why-am-i-a-tool-maker%3f/&quot;&gt;http://kartar.net/2011/11/why-am-i-a-tool-maker%3f/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chef is purposefully not opinionated about what you might want to manage
with it. But the flexibility is there to provide cookbooks with
expressive DSL, for example this one for application deployment. The
description of these as &amp;ldquo;deployment macros&amp;rdquo; I like, and the fact it&amp;rsquo;s
already managing application written in Java, Scala, Erlang, Ruby and
static sites bodes well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.boundary.com/2011/11/01/the-apps-cookbook-and-application-deployments.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.boundary.com/2011/11/01/the-apps-cookbook-and-application-deployments.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice introductory presentation covering why packaging up your Java
applications as RPMs is generally a good idea. Covers everything from
the problems, what you need to do to fix them and other advantages like
simplifying configuration management manifests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/actionjackx/automated-java-deployments-with-rpm&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/actionjackx/automated-java-deployments-with-rpm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great &amp;ldquo;one month with chef&amp;rdquo; article, talking through the learning
curve, how it changes how work got done and with a great list of things
worth knowing before starting. Well worth reading if you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of
getting in to Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/month-with-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/month-with-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensu is a new take on the monitoring problem, using a message queue for
command distribution and discovery and a fast key value store for
keeping track of hosts and checks. It certainly sounds interesting,
although I&amp;rsquo;d love to see a screen capture of similar to get a better
feel for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://portertech.ca/2011/11/01/sensu-a-monitoring-framework/&quot;&gt;http://portertech.ca/2011/11/01/sensu-a-monitoring-framework/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sonian/sensu&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sonian/sensu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Databaseliner describes itself as &amp;ldquo;a tool for spidering a database to
produce a referentially integral subset of data&amp;rdquo;. One use case is for
creating useful datasets for testing purposes based on production data.
Currently it comes with outputs for Postgres and Oracle, but with a bit
of hacking you could add others too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steppenwells/databaseliner&quot;&gt;https://github.com/steppenwells/databaseliner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VirtualBox guest additions updates can cause problems with Vagrant
base boxes which haven&amp;rsquo;t been created with the latest tools installed.
The three way fight between the version of vagrant, virtual box and the
guest additions has bit me personally a few times. This plugin aims to
help, providing an option for the vagrant file to keep everything up to
date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/30/issue-44/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/30/issue-44</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 44 &amp;ndash; 30th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week, another set of high quality articles from around the web.
This time next week devopsweekly will probably have over 2000
subscribers which is pretty impressive. And I still believe we&amp;rsquo;re just
the early adopters at this point. Anyway, on with the real content and a
shamelessly promoted opportunity for someone to come and work with me at
the day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in any doubt that devops is attracting a wider audience of
late then have a read through this Wired article. I have to admit I&amp;rsquo;m
mainly including this due to the title: The Chef, the Puppet, and the
Sexy IT Admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/10/chef_and_puppet/&quot;&gt;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/10/chef_and_puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppet has a pretty powerful extension system taking advantage of Ruby
to add new functionality at runtime. This article, the first in a
series, covers some of those integration points and shows lots of code
examples that making it easier to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/10/29/puppet-extension-points-part-1/&quot;&gt;http://www.masterzen.fr/2011/10/29/puppet-extension-points-part-1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosdem, the free and open source conference held each year in Belgium is
looking for main track speakers for next year event. Last years
configuration management room was excellent so hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll see more
good devops flavoured content next year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2012/call-main-track&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2012/call-main-track&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article acting as a counterpoint to all the ones talking about
moving to cloud based hosting. Mixpanel have recently moved to dedicated
hardware, getting better performance and lower costs out of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.mixpanel.com/2011/10/27/why-we-moved-off-the-cloud/&quot;&gt;http://code.mixpanel.com/2011/10/27/why-we-moved-off-the-cloud/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Reese gave a presentation at the recent Camp DevOps about some of
the overlaps and resulting benefits of adopting devops approaches in a
cloud environment. The main thread appears to be APIs for everything,
allowing for the entire system (not just the software) to be defined in
code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/10/23/devops-in-the-cloud-explained/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/10/23/devops-in-the-cloud-explained/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice rebuttal of the argument that you can automate yourself out of a
job. Also nice to think about documentation as a fallback when
automation is not possible or too costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/10/automate-will-i-lose-my-job.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/10/automate-will-i-lose-my-job.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another writeup from a Camp DevOps talk, this time from Seth Thomson and
Chris Read on Overcoming Organizational Hurdles. The reiteration that
change is hard and communication is important is always welcome, and the
idea that you should get people to pull you in rather than push them
into doing something I found interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/10/22/overcoming-organizational-hurdles/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/10/22/overcoming-organizational-hurdles/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I current work for the UK Government, in a brand new department called
Government Digital Service. Our remit is nothing short of fundamentally
changing how the Government operates online, and we&amp;rsquo;re looking for more
smart people. We&amp;rsquo;re currently on the lookout for developers and systems

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 1.4 of Rundeck, the framework for automating ad-hoc and routine
command execution, has been released. Feels like development is
progressing at quite a clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtolabs/rundeck/blob/v1.4.0.1/RELEASE.md&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dtolabs/rundeck/blob/v1.4.0.1/RELEASE.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at GitHub have talked quite a bit about Hubot, their campfire
bot which triggers deploys, queries the web and opens the office door
among other things. A cleaned up version of the code has been released
and we&amp;rsquo;re already seeing lots of plugins being added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks appear to be building tools around Graphite of late.
Tattle looks interesting, described as a self service alerting and
dashboard frontend for graphite. So now you can get alerts when data
sets change or thresholds are passed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 43 - 23rd October 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/23/issue-43/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/23/issue-43</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 43 &amp;ndash; 23rd October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to our usual Sunday schedule this week after the Devopsdays special
last weekend. Even without a very lively conference their are still lots
of well written articles and interesting new tools around. Hopefully
something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment is always a hot topic, and this series of posts is looking to
document common patterns including dark launches, feature flags, smoke
tests and backwards compatibility. Essential reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/10/18/deploy-all-the-things/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/10/18/deploy-all-the-things/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of pattern repositories has been around a while and can be a
good way of documenting best practices. This site currently covers
environment abstraction, fix the automation, not the symptom and
database changes as code. Hopefully more on the way, and more discussion
around shared patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopswire.com/patterns/repository&quot;&gt;http://devopswire.com/patterns/repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing Git is becoming more and more important with the huge amount of
useful software found on GitHub and other online repositories like
BitBucket. This online book looks an excellent starting place for
learning all the ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yanpritzker.com/git-book/&quot;&gt;http://yanpritzker.com/git-book/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagios is the mainstay for many people monitoring hosts and services,
and this projects adds a JSON based API and a command line interface for
getting information out of Nagois. Patches welcome for adding new
features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qq.is/article/announcing-a-nagios-api&quot;&gt;http://qq.is/article/announcing-a-nagios-api&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of interesting tools along with configuration management
and a nice command line interface can make experimenting with things
much simpler. This project takes the Graylog2 logging application and
uses puppet and capistrano to turn a new virtual machine into a fully
working logging server. Can someone do this for Graphite as well please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/aussielunix/graylog2-appliance&quot;&gt;https://bitbucket.org/aussielunix/graylog2-appliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice presentation bringing design and quality assurance roles into the
typical developer and operations mix. I particularly liked the Given,
When, Then examples of operations and support stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/ingineeringit/design-dev-qa-ops&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/ingineeringit/design-dev-qa-ops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes from the Camp Devops talk on how Groupon have scaled their
operations. From 100 servers in a single location a year ago, to more
than 1000 servers in six locations today. Groupon have an in-house
configuration management tool called Roller and the notes cover some of
the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/10/22/groupon-clean-and-simple-devops-with-roller/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/10/22/groupon-clean-and-simple-devops-with-roller/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you store sensitive data for use in configuration management is an
important topic. Chef now has encrypted data bags which are a nice
solution. This article covers a puppet approach using the new Hiera
backend. Good post with lots of code examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigdunn.org/2011/10/secret-variables-in-puppet-with-hiera-and-gpg/&quot;&gt;http://www.craigdunn.org/2011/10/secret-variables-in-puppet-with-hiera-and-gpg/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short presentation on testing in an operations context. Lots of good
ideas, and importantly examples, of the types of tests you might write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrislaco.com/slides/clerb-testing.pdf&quot;&gt;http://chrislaco.com/slides/clerb-testing.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week, another Statsd clone. This time in Scala. It&amp;rsquo;s compatible
with the statsd protocol so it&amp;rsquo;s a drop in replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojodna/metricsd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mojodna/metricsd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice looking command line tool from Instagram for making SSH access to
EC2 instances easier without having to remember public instance
addresses or deal ever changing DNS entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/11399488246/simplifying-ec2-ssh-connections&quot;&gt;http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/11399488246/simplifying-ec2-ssh-connections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of continuous delivery examples have been built on top of a
continuous integration server, but Nariya is built from scratch using
node.js. It&amp;rsquo;s quite opinionated and looks to be best suited for other
node.js projects hosted on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arunoda/nariya&quot;&gt;https://github.com/arunoda/nariya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 42 - 17th October 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/17/issue-42/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/17/issue-42</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 42 &amp;ndash; 17th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day late but hopefully the extra content will placate any angry
readers. I just got back from another excellent Devopsdays event, this
time in Sweden. Thanks hugely to Patrick, Ulf and all those involved in
organising, speaking and participating. For those that couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it
here are lots of the slides, and a few notes from some of the open
spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Devopsdays&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely one of the highlights of the event was the talk from
Mitchell Hashimoto (of Vagrant fame). It stresses that all the many
things we put under the devops banner exist on a scale and talks about
the order you might try and implement many of the things we talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/mitchellh/p/the-wide-range-of-devops&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/mitchellh/p/the-wide-range-of-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian Simpson and Tom Sulston gave one of the talks in Sweden, entitled
everything I know about continuous integration I learned from System
Administration. It has a number of good takeaway points about how you
may be going about CI. The slides only tell part of the story so watch
out for the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.build-doctor.com/2011/10/17/everything-i-know-about-continuous-integration-i-learned-from-systems-administration/&quot;&gt;http://www.build-doctor.com/2011/10/17/everything-i-know-about-continuous-integration-i-learned-from-systems-administration/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Vincent&amp;rsquo;s talk stressed the importance of tools, at least some of
the time anyway. The talk took a number of common areas of operations
(configuration management, packaging, monitoring, etc.) and tried to
show a before and after snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/sometimes-tools-matter&quot;&gt;http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/sometimes-tools-matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Ignite talks by Michael Brunton-Spall from The Guardian
seemed to entertain most of the audience. It&amp;rsquo;s a lightning quick tale of
a real project with a number of ups and downs, all talking place over a
matter of days. A good talk developer to developer to challenge
assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mibuk/ignitedevopsdays-why-devs-need-ops&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/mibuk/ignitedevopsdays-why-devs-need-ops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the lightning talks was on ITIL and Devops. The presenter has
nicely made available both the slides and the notes, which at least
until the video is available, make interesting reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rslomkow.org/share/963830F6-B592-4B41-ACE7-ED4344D9FFDB/ITIL-for-agile-notes.pdf&quot;&gt;http://rslomkow.org/share/963830F6-B592-4B41-ACE7-ED4344D9FFDB/ITIL-for-agile-notes.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the open spaces I missed has already been well written up. This
one covered Java application development and for those involved in that
topic every day this sounded excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mccartney.ie/wordpress/2011/10/246/&quot;&gt;http://www.mccartney.ie/wordpress/2011/10/246/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other open spaces covered tools people where finding useful.
This post includes links to all of them, a good 40 or 50 in total. Not
all of them I&amp;rsquo;m convinced by but it&amp;rsquo;s a good starting place for some
research if you like keeping up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://paperairoplane.net/?p=320&quot;&gt;http://paperairoplane.net/?p=320&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all the Devopsdays content isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, all of the videos from
Puppetconf are now available. The talks I saw were excellent, and I&amp;rsquo;m
hoping to find time to catch all the ones in the tracks I didn&amp;rsquo;t get
along to. Lots of good puppet content, plus a good number of talks
relevant to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/videos-from-puppetconf-available/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/videos-from-puppetconf-available/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good long explanation of why to choose Chef, which (apart from the
many good examples) is really a solid argument for any form of
configuration management. The good points and bad give it balance and
the mythbusting is welcome (in particular in light of some of the
comments anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/why-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/why-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays was definitely a practitioners conference, so it&amp;rsquo;s still
great to see articles like this one, covering what Devops is and why you
should care. It&amp;rsquo;s main points are around host devops approaches can work
in agile software teams, with the main emphasis on getting development
and operations together rather than pitting then against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agileelephant.blogspot.com/2011/09/introduction-to-devops.html?m=1&quot;&gt;http://agileelephant.blogspot.com/2011/09/introduction-to-devops.html?m=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather provocative post suggesting an end to the Sysadmin within 10
years. Some of the points are obvious, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s more about
evolution and increasing specialisation (not everything is a web
application for instance). Lots of comments too which make for some
interesting points amongst the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://peebs.org/ill-probably-never-hire-another-pure-sysadmin&quot;&gt;http://peebs.org/ill-probably-never-hire-another-pure-sysadmin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla are interesting in that the majority of the code they produce is
open source. Getting in-house developers up and running can be tricky in
some organisation, but Mozilla want to encourage external developers
too. This post covers that problem, and the current solution using
Vagrant to distribute a virtual machine that anyone can get start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/&quot;&gt;http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late night deployments are generally a bad idea and a sign of other
wider issues. This post does a fantastic job of taking all the reasons
you probably do it and debunking them, in particular with examples of
using feature flags to solve some time depend events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://briancrescimanno.com/2011/09/29/why-are-you-still-deploying-overnight/&quot;&gt;http://briancrescimanno.com/2011/09/29/why-are-you-still-deploying-overnight/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using EC2 and you can&amp;rsquo;t get your instances booted quickly
because of the time taken for a configuration management run this
approach might be of interest. It&amp;rsquo;s demonstrating a puppet module which
can be used to keep a set of AMI images up to date with puppet
manifests, so when you boot new instances they are already bang up to
date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/rapid-scaling-with-auto-generated-amis-using-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/rapid-scaling-with-auto-generated-amis-using-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Vagrant and doing Ruby development a few people have
asked how I open the source of gems on the guest. Actually I just use
vim all the time on the virtual machine but if you&amp;rsquo;re happier with
Textmate or and IDE of some description running on the host then vagrant
bundler tools is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mocoso/vagrant-bundler-tools&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mocoso/vagrant-bundler-tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statsd, the stats aggregation tool for Graphite from Etsy, is very nice.
But some folks just aren&amp;rsquo;t happy or able to run Node.js applications.
Statsite is a Python implementation of the tool that supports all the
Graphite data types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kiip/statsite&quot;&gt;https://github.com/kiip/statsite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fig describes itself as a utility for configuring environments and
managing dependencies across a team of developers. It&amp;rsquo;s something like
Apache Ivy, but not just for Java applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mfoemmel/fig&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mfoemmel/fig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 41 &amp;ndash; 9th October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to be off on another devops floured trip this week, to
Sweden for the third Devopsdays Europe event. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping it will be
just as interesting, friendly and informative as last year. If you&amp;rsquo;re
going to be attending come find me and say Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really nice article which should be relevant to anyone involved in
software development and operations, about how to ensure useful
communication in a crisis. Much of this is about up front planning and
practice, but the examples and approaches make this article a good read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fire-drills-communications-strategy-in-a-crisis/&quot;&gt;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fire-drills-communications-strategy-in-a-crisis/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has spent lots of time with Python but who is now mainly
writing Ruby this post about Ruby becoming the de facto System
Administration programming language is interesting. Some of the comments
are also interesting, even if some devolve into language wars a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-ruby-is-beating-python-in-battle.html&quot;&gt;http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-ruby-is-beating-python-in-battle.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like the Chef Windows support has been coming along nicely of
late and people are posting more how-to&amp;rsquo;s. This one shows how to ensure
idempotence by checking whether something is installed in the Windows
registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://delivermind.blogspot.com/2011/10/windows-msi-idempotence-with-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://delivermind.blogspot.com/2011/10/windows-msi-idempotence-with-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plea to get rid of silos in organisation which allow one group (lets
say developers) to cause pain to another (their operations colleagues).
I definitely agree with the theme, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the solution is
to get rid of different roles completely, more to improve collaboration
and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.recursivity.com/post/10842820535/developers-must-feel-the-pain-of-operations&quot;&gt;http://blog.recursivity.com/post/10842820535/developers-must-feel-the-pain-of-operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Puppet Labs folk have posted a short list of blog posts from
attendees to Puppet Conf last week. I&amp;rsquo;m still digesting some of the
excellent talks. Anyone else who made it along and has written up their
thoughts let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/puppetconf-blog-round-up/&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/puppetconf-blog-round-up/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good set of Vagrant tutorial blog posts taking you from getting
started, through creating your own base boxes up to using Puppet to
manage software on the virtual machine. Rather that just the facts found
in the official docs these posts are a little more flavoured by a real
world scenario and make a good starting point for anyone interested in
Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.me/2011/10/05/vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://devops.me/2011/10/05/vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.me/2011/10/06/building-baseboxes/&quot;&gt;http://devops.me/2011/10/06/building-baseboxes/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of updating the puppet modules on your puppet master is using
the mcmasterupdate collective plugin. This article shows how this is
done using a simple svn commit hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flybyunix.carlcaum.com/2011/10/automatically-updating-your-puppet.html&quot;&gt;http://flybyunix.carlcaum.com/2011/10/automatically-updating-your-puppet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people talk about their software architecture, but fewer talk
about mistakes and how they solved them over time. This article about
how Etsy has changed over time is interesting, stressing the positive
impact of web operations folks on the eventual system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/10/when-clever-goes-wrong-how-etsy-overcame-poor-architectural-choices.ars&quot;&gt;http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/10/when-clever-goes-wrong-how-etsy-overcame-poor-architectural-choices.ars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camp Devops, which is taking place later this month in Chicago, now has
a full line-up of talks announced. With sessions on Continuous Delivery,
Puppet, Jenkins and Graphite amongst other topics and a day long
hackathon it should be a pretty good tools focused few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDash is a nice looking project for anyone using Graphite. It&amp;rsquo;s a small
Ruby web application designed for building customisable dashboards of
Graphite metrics. You describe what you want in a simple configuration
and you can easily run the dashboard on Heroku if you&amp;rsquo;re not up on
hosting Ruby based web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 40 - 2nd October 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/02/issue-40/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2011/10/02/issue-40</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 40 &amp;ndash; 2nd October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, sorry for the missing issue last week. Sunday had me
travelling the 5000 miles or so back home from Puppetconf so it
definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t due to a lack of good content. Puppetconf was
excellent and I&amp;rsquo;ll make an effort to track down any blog posts I can
find once I get a moment. Now on with two weeks worth of news and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more people start using tools like Chef an ecosystem can develop, and
Grill is the first commercial tool I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that plugs into a Chef
based infrastructure. It&amp;rsquo;s a monitoring tool which makes use of Chef and
lets you see nodes which have got out of sync amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cyclecomputing.com/grill/overview&quot;&gt;http://cyclecomputing.com/grill/overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love finding good sized configuration management repos to delve into.
This one comes from the folks at Wikimedia and contains lots of puppet
modules folks might find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/09/19/ever-wondered-how-the-wikimedia-servers-are-configured/&quot;&gt;http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/09/19/ever-wondered-how-the-wikimedia-servers-are-configured/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teams have certain tasks that can only safely be run by one person
or group at once, and the use of some token to prevent disaster is a
common pattern. Pass the Puppy is a simple service (you can run your own
version if you prefer) to help in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pass-the-puppy.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;http://pass-the-puppy.heroku.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stevemoyer.net/2011/09/distributed-check-in-tokens-pass-puppy.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.stevemoyer.net/2011/09/distributed-check-in-tokens-pass-puppy.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this article about the changing skill set of developers
interesting. It mentioned the need to know a little more about making
applications that are deployable and manageable, as well as lots of
other things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/202999/what-todays-software-developers-need-know&quot;&gt;http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/202999/what-todays-software-developers-need-know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RemoteAdmin is a Android and iPhone application for managing Foreman and
Puppet. It&amp;rsquo;s baed on the APIs exposed by those tools and the screenshots
look excellent. I&amp;rsquo;d love to see a review of this form anyone who&amp;rsquo;s
already using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/logicminds/remoteadmin-mobile/wiki&quot;&gt;https://github.com/logicminds/remoteadmin-mobile/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Foundry seems to be having quite a push to make running a cluster
yourself easier which is good. This post covers running multiple nodes
using Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/10816758982/using-chef-to-customize-multi-node-cloud-foundry&quot;&gt;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/10816758982/using-chef-to-customize-multi-node-cloud-foundry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone likes the default Puppet requirement for mandatory client
certificates. This gist introduces a different approach that uses facts
rather than the SSL Distinguished Name to determine the classes for a
node, making reusing certs easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1182243&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/1182243&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice write-up of the build a cloud day ahead of Puppetconf. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
manage to get to Portland in time for this event but it sounded very
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/openshift/blogs/a-report-from-build-a-cloud-day-at-puppetconf&quot;&gt;https://www.redhat.com/openshift/blogs/a-report-from-build-a-cloud-day-at-puppetconf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can just drop everything and start using a configuration
management tool. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t work towards Chef or Puppet
by making existing shell scripts easier to manage. Rerun looks an
interesting approach to making a standard interface for an existing
suite of shell tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/9/26/puppet-and-chef-rock-doh-what-about-all-these-shell-scripts.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/9/26/puppet-and-chef-rock-doh-what-about-all-these-shell-scripts.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtolabs/rerun/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dtolabs/rerun/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our infrastructure is code, things like change management can be
more easily automated. This article delves into how the folks at
Alassian use their own suite of tools to manage a request for a change.
Always interesting to see other folks processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2011/09/puppet-change-management-for-devops.html&quot;&gt;http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2011/09/puppet-change-management-for-devops.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been increasingly using FPM for making system packages, so FPM
Cookery looks interesting. It uses FPM for creating packages, but
provides some conventions and tools around building the software you
want in the package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bernd/fpm-cookery&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bernd/fpm-cookery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to draw diagrams but not felt like moving out of vim (or
your editor of choice)? With Ditaa you can generate a wide range of flow
chart diagrams from nothing more than ascii text. It had me at the
example at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More folks are using Configuration Management tools as part of
application deployment and this is a nice  (and very well documented)
puppet module aimed at managing Python WSGI and Django web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.uggedal.com/deploying-wsgi-applications-with-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://journal.uggedal.com/deploying-wsgi-applications-with-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uggedal/puppet-module-webapp&quot;&gt;https://github.com/uggedal/puppet-module-webapp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scales is a Python web application and library for collecting metrics
data from your application or servers. It has a nice built in web server
for showing data and integrates with Graphite for tracking data over
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greplin/scales&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Greplin/scales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 39 &amp;ndash; 18th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next weeks issue of Devops Weekly might be a little late, because next
week I&amp;rsquo;m heading to Portland for PuppetConf. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be there
come and say hello , I&amp;rsquo;ll be the small English fellow hanging around the
devops track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme for Devopsdays Europe is out, and I&amp;rsquo;m even more happy that
I&amp;rsquo;ll be making it along again that before. Six really interesting
looking sessions with a good mix of case studies and interesting
discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/program/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/program/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of technologies, programming languages and systems used these
days for building web applications is much larger than even a few years
ago. This site looks to be a interesting overview of that change, with a
long wiki like list of technologies to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackparts.com/&quot;&gt;http://stackparts.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canonical folks have started posting some examples of using Ensemble
to build various stacks. This post covers a node.js, mongodb and haproxy
deployment. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in the specific technology
used, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the command line interface for working
with ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/09/node-js-and-mongodb-on-ubuntu/&quot;&gt;http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/09/node-js-and-mongodb-on-ubuntu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice impassioned plea to get ops savvy people involved in the design
of services alongside developers. Also talks about the importance of
positioning operational metrics and data as something of interest to
developers as well as prioritising what to do first in the move towards
a devops mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/12/wont-somebody-please-think-of-the-systems/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/12/wont-somebody-please-think-of-the-systems/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post looks at what hoops need jumping through to get CloudFoundry
running in EC2 from the latest source. Particularly impressive is
running the applications across multiple instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudsoftcorp.com/blogs/first-steps-with-cloud-foundry-on-amazon-ec2&quot;&gt;http://www.cloudsoftcorp.com/blogs/first-steps-with-cloud-foundry-on-amazon-ec2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another setting up CloudFoundry article, this time using the new
packages in Ubuntu 11.10. Having started hacking on CloudFoundry when it
was released it&amp;rsquo;s great to see working packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/08/howto-install-cloudfoundry-server-paas.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/08/howto-install-cloudfoundry-server-paas.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice 20 minute talk on Devops, Devops, Devops from Kris Buytaert at
the recent Startup Weekend Brussels. A nice introductory run through
many of the devops concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IhstaBetkk&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IhstaBetkk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with as many servers as Facebook will always have some of them
down. FBAR is one of the tools they have developed to make this as self
healing as possible and this article suggests the software now
maintained by two full time developers does the work of two hundred
system administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/making-facebook-self-healing/10150275248698920&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/making-facebook-self-healing/10150275248698920&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PubSub Huddle is a free one-day conference in London to talk about all
things messaging. Talks on RabbitMQ,  ØMQ and an afternoon of lightning
talks and ad-hoc sessions is planned. Worthwhile if you&amp;rsquo;re in London on
Friday 23rd of September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pubsubhuddle.com/&quot;&gt;http://pubsubhuddle.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Puppet is described as a Ruby DSL for Puppet, giving those that
prefer it a different way of writing Puppet manifests in this case as
Ruby classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/railsmachine/shadow_puppet/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/railsmachine/shadow_puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcollective 1.3.1 is out, which is a development branch release and
features a much improved node filtering syntax and a fast node to node
communication mechanism via the same middleware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/releasenotes.html#1_3_1&quot;&gt;http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/releasenotes.html#1_3_1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boss is a library designed to allow you to perform simple master
election while knowing little about your peers, specifically designed
for use with Chef. Light on documentation, but the included Vagrant file
lets you try it out very quickly. Hopefully something we&amp;rsquo;ll see in other
projects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fujin/boss&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fujin/boss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecks is another new tool designed as a simple way to get data out of a
remote machine using SNMP. It&amp;rsquo;s a python application, with a simple to
use interface for extracting information like uptime, load average,
running processes and cpu usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cread/ecks&quot;&gt;https://github.com/cread/ecks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 38 &amp;ndash; 11th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of seeing the growth in any community is the growth in events
around it. And as I&amp;rsquo;m finding more and more events I&amp;rsquo;ll try and
highlight any interesting ones each week. If you&amp;rsquo;re involved in
organising anything that might be relevant let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devops issue of the Cutter IT Journal is out with guest editor
Patrick Debois. It&amp;rsquo;s available for free download if you provide some
details and contains several articles including process discussion and
case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cutter.com/offers/devopsrevolution.html&quot;&gt;http://www.cutter.com/offers/devopsrevolution.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a particularly large and dynamic puppet install you
might decide that using the FQDN has some limitations around every node
needing a sensible DNS entry. This article discusses a different
approach using UUIDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetize.me/2011/09/05/using-uuids-for-agent-certnames/&quot;&gt;http://puppetize.me/2011/09/05/using-uuids-for-agent-certnames/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more weekly niche newsletters have launched recently that might be
of interest to devops folks interested in Perl or NoSQL data stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://perlweekly.com/&quot;&gt;http://perlweekly.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nosqlweekly.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.nosqlweekly.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like articles that go into detail about using a different approach to
solve increasingly common problems, and this article about processing a
large song database using map reduce is great. Increasingly important to
know about as the amount of data we collect increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://musicmachinery.com/2011/09/04/how-to-process-a-million-songs-in-20-minutes/&quot;&gt;http://musicmachinery.com/2011/09/04/how-to-process-a-million-songs-in-20-minutes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started with Chef or Puppet is probably the hard part, so
detailed walkthroughs like this are particularly valuable. This post
covers writing a Chef cookbook, with lots of code examples and lots of
discussion and the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/guide-to-writing-chef-cookbooks&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/guide-to-writing-chef-cookbooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article introducing jitter as something you might want to measure
when looking at performance. Jitter is an unpredictable variation in
response, so reducing it is subtly different to reducing response time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/09/06/jitter.html&quot;&gt;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/09/06/jitter.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone doing any on-call support of a software application will probably
find this article, and the paper it references, interesting. Briefly
talks about the difference between fault tolerance and fault protection,
and how that frames when you and how you&amp;rsquo;re altering system should call
a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/09/08/fault-tolerance-and-protection/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/09/08/fault-tolerance-and-protection/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is pretty interesting, but with all the moving parts it&amp;rsquo;s not
the easiest thing to get up and running. The next release of Ubuntu
(Oneiric Ocelot) ships with a full set of packages for running
everything. And this post shows you how to install and run them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zulcss.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/el-diablo-running-nova-on-oneiric/&quot;&gt;http://zulcss.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/el-diablo-running-nova-on-oneiric/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Events&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A event that might be of interest to readers in London is CITCON
(Continuous Integration and Testing Conference) . It brings together
people from every corner of the software development industry to discuss
continuous integration and the type of testing that goes along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://citconf.com/london2011/&quot;&gt;http://citconf.com/london2011/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another devops flavoured conference is coming to Chicago in October on
the 22nd and 23rd. It&amp;rsquo;s focused on automation and tools and early bird
prices are available until the 15th of September too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://campdevops.com/&quot;&gt;http://campdevops.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves backups, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure anyone really likes setting
them up and monitoring them. This project might be of interest depending
on your requirements. It provides a large range of backup methods for
several databases, along with different off site locations and syncing
mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup&quot;&gt;https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 37 &amp;ndash; 4th September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the biggest issue this week but a few good posts and tools,
especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using Chef. That&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been busier than
usual this week rather than a lack of content, so if you spot, write or
build anything you think would be worth including do email me at
&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#97;&amp;#x69;&amp;#108;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#103;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x68;&amp;#x61;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&quot;&gt;&amp;#103;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#x40;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#97;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#x76;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One think I&amp;rsquo;ve really liked about the nascent Devops community has been
it&amp;rsquo;s reaction to criticism. This week an article from The IT Skeptic
raised a number of issues, some of which had more to do with a seemingly
anti-agile leaning. What was more interesting was the comments and a
follow up post by Ernest Mueller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itskeptic.org/devops-and-traditional-itsm-why-devops-wont-change&quot;&gt;http://www.itskeptic.org/devops-and-traditional-itsm-why-devops-wont-change&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/02/addressing-the-it-skeptics-view-on-devops/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/02/addressing-the-it-skeptics-view-on-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things no-one surely likes about Nagios is writing the
configuration files by hand. This article from the folks at Fotopedia
shows how they are using Chef to generate the Nagios configs, something
that makes it much more likely you&amp;rsquo;ll add checks in the first place.
Lots of code examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice looking presentation from the people at Slideshare at Devopsdays
Bangalore. A nice, honest, success story, and one that&amp;rsquo;s not scared of
revealing how messed up things had been. From zero deployments in four
months to five times a day. all with better uptime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/kapil/devops-at-slideshare-talk-at-devopsdays-bangalore-2011&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/kapil/devops-at-slideshare-talk-at-devopsdays-bangalore-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although everyone&amp;rsquo;s operating environment is similar and tools can often
just slot straight in, some industries or companies come with pretty
specific requirements. Picklive are using Chef but had some additional
needs around everything being over SSL and not displaying stack traces.
An interesting blog post resulted about how they dealt with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.picklive.com/2011/09/02/chef-on-steroids.html&quot;&gt;http://tech.picklive.com/2011/09/02/chef-on-steroids.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presentation from InfoQ by Chris Read and Dan North on Agile Operations.
Worth watching if only for the synchronised fairy tale reading at the
start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Agile-Operations-Optimizing-Business&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Agile-Operations-Optimizing-Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppetlabs have released version 1.2 of their Puppet Enterprise product.
It now ships with even more compliance related tools as well as the
managed installer for all the components and professional support as
before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-puppet-enterprise-1-2/?utm_campaign=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=socnet&quot;&gt;http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-puppet-enterprise-1-2/?utm_campaign=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=socnet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlas from Ning is a tool used to define a template for systems which
can be instantiated, torn down and upgraded. It uses Chef in the middle,
but provides a DSL onto fro describing a system &amp;ndash; so at at slightly
different abstraction level closer to something like CloudFormation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.ning.com/2011/06/atlas-2/&quot;&gt;http://code.ning.com/2011/06/atlas-2/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ning/atlas/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ning/atlas/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spice looks to be a new project aimed at giving you a API for
integrating with a Chef server. Not many examples yet but worth keeping
any eye on if you&amp;rsquo;re building tools around Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone thinking of coming along to the next devopsdays event in Goteborg
in October might want to know that the early bird ticket price is due to
end on 1st of September. And anyone still thinking of submitting a talk
idea needs to do so before the 15th of September.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/.&quot;&gt;http://www.devopsdays.org/.&lt;/a&gt; See everyone there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great presentation from Froscon by Kris Buytaert entitled Devops,
Devops, Devops. It&amp;rsquo;s another nice introduction to the topic and a call
to get involved in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/KrisBuytaert/devops-devops-devops-at-froscon&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/KrisBuytaert/devops-devops-devops-at-froscon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting blog post on what is termed here the configuration
management divide, partly focusing on getting developers and sysadmins
collaborating on config management, and why the deployment story
sometimes gets in the way. I have some thoughts and code on this I need
to write up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/08/22/the-configuration-management-divide/&quot;&gt;http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/08/22/the-configuration-management-divide/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article by Luke Kanies of Puppet Labs which, as well as being a nice
introduction to devops, reveals some of the results of a recent survey
on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/08/devops-what-it-is-why-it-exist.php&quot;&gt;http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/08/devops-what-it-is-why-it-exist.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When and what to virtualise is a question that needs dealing with in
most environments, and this article covers a few basic issues, along
with some recommendations and opinions. Worth reading if it&amp;rsquo;s something
you&amp;rsquo;re new to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scalingexperts.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/the-correct-way-to-use-virtualization/&quot;&gt;http://scalingexperts.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/the-correct-way-to-use-virtualization/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone chooses to use a puppetmaster when using puppet, and this
article covers a simple approach to kicking of puppet runs using Fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magpiebrain.com/2011/08/21/using-fabric-to-apply-puppet-scripts/&quot;&gt;http://www.magpiebrain.com/2011/08/21/using-fabric-to-apply-puppet-scripts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of the videos from Devops Down Under are now available. They
include talks on Kanban for IT Operations, feature flipping, building
high-performing teams and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/devopsdownunder/videos&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/devopsdownunder/videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon continue adding popular services to those available in EC2, this
week rolling out Elasticache. It&amp;rsquo;s an in-memory cache which talks the
memcached protocol, so if you&amp;rsquo;re already using memcached instances on
EC2 it should be simple to try this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/08/amazon-elasticache-distributed-in-memory-caching.html&quot;&gt;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/08/amazon-elasticache-distributed-in-memory-caching.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say the explosion of ops tools hasn&amp;rsquo;t really hit the shores
of those working in a Windows environment. This article takes a look at
this issue and outlines why some Windows only tools right now would be a
good step forward and make some of the problems easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://readsource.co.uk/2011/08/23/a-vision-for-configuration-management-on-windows/&quot;&gt;http://readsource.co.uk/2011/08/23/a-vision-for-configuration-management-on-windows/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever needed to spread execution of commands across a few
servers? Well this article looks at that problem with 10,000 servers and
shows a few approaches, with code and graphed results, of how one team
approached the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/ServerLoadSpreading&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/ServerLoadSpreading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice in-depth article on managing your personal workstation using
Chef, written by a self confessed newbie to all things configuration
management. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty good introduction to some of the Chef
moving parts too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unwiredcouch.com/2011/08/25/setting-up-workstations-with-chef-newbie-edition.html&quot;&gt;http://unwiredcouch.com/2011/08/25/setting-up-workstations-with-chef-newbie-edition.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting piece on the benefits of continuous deployment. It&amp;rsquo;s a
little focused on engineer driven startups but still covers some of the
reasons why investing in the tools to deploy this way lead to more
important cultural changes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benmgreene.com/post/9295282784/why-continuous-deployment-matters&quot;&gt;http://www.benmgreene.com/post/9295282784/why-continuous-deployment-matters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the puppet lint tool from last week, this week I came
across some rspec matches for testing puppet modules. After quite a bit
of talk about testing configuration management code we now have quite a
range of tools to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of applications exposing information about themselves
over http, and Insight looks a nice dashboard for displaying this sort
of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ryangreenhall.com/2011/08/introducing-insight-a-dashboard-to-collate-status-information-from-multiple-application-instances/&quot;&gt;http://www.ryangreenhall.com/2011/08/introducing-insight-a-dashboard-to-collate-status-information-from-multiple-application-instances/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks have been getting interested in node.js, and quite a few
of the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve featured in this newsletter over the weeks have used
node. Anyone put off by javascript though might find node.x of interest.
It&amp;rsquo;s basically a node port to the JVM, currently with examples in Jruby
and Groovy with more planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/purplefox/node.x&quot;&gt;https://github.com/purplefox/node.x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using VMWare fusion but looking wishing for a nice command
line interface then fission might be exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 35 &amp;ndash; 21st August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it was about this week but lots of the articles I came
across were about systems orchestration. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a hot topic,
with more tools and more discussion coming along all the time. I&amp;rsquo;m
making sense of that with the help of this nice graphic from Canonical
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ensemble.ubuntu.com/DevOps&quot;&gt;https://ensemble.ubuntu.com/DevOps&lt;/a&gt; which I really want on a T-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devops Cafe is back in the form of Devops Drop, an under 10 minutes
podcast filled with discussion and news from John Willis and Damon
Edwards. In three days we&amp;rsquo;ve seen three episodes covering details of
crowbar, cloudfoundry, dynect, netflix, hack day and lots more. Looking
forward to future episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/17/devops-drop-001.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/17/devops-drop-001.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/18/devops-drop-002.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/18/devops-drop-002.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/19/devops-drop-003.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/8/19/devops-drop-003.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great series of posts about what I think is a very common setup &amp;ndash;
namely a redundant six machine web application cluster. Goes over the
basics of load balancing, redundant database setup and even goes into
the costs associated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rackerhacker.com/redundant-cloud-hosting-configuration-guide/&quot;&gt;http://rackerhacker.com/redundant-cloud-hosting-configuration-guide/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensemble looks to be interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s being developed by Canonical and
is another tool aimed at orchestrating applications across multiple
servers. It will be available in Ubuntu 11.10 or you can get it from a
PPA now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/08/ensemble-the-service-orchestration-framework-for-hard-core-devops/&quot;&gt;http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/08/ensemble-the-service-orchestration-framework-for-hard-core-devops/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ensemble.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;https://ensemble.ubuntu.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upstart is an event-based replacement for the the init daemon which
appears to be picking up lots of fans. It also has unbelievably good
documentation all in one place. This huge page covers why it exists, how
to use it and lots of cookbook style patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/&quot;&gt;http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice quick presentation entitled Mastering Complex Deployments.
Covering what the problems are, why they are unlikely to go away and
what we can do about them. I particularly like the line &amp;ldquo;Relentlessly
Remove Variation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/Urbancode/mastering-complexdeployments&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/Urbancode/mastering-complexdeployments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing what appears to be a theme this week, I came across a nice
introductory article on Mcollective. Describing the problems simply and
showing examples of some of the bundled tools. A good starting point if
you&amp;rsquo;ve yet to look into Mcollective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redbluemagenta.com/2011/08/19/mcollective/&quot;&gt;http://redbluemagenta.com/2011/08/19/mcollective/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcollective is often thought to be a Puppet specific tool, especially
after it moved house to Puppetlabs. But nothing is really Puppet
specific, as this post shows. As well as quickly presenting Mcollective
this article covers some basic Chef integration and points out a few
things that need addressing. I particularly like that a Vagrant box is
provided for anyone to experiment with themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptocracy.com/using-mcollective-with-chef&quot;&gt;http://www.cryptocracy.com/using-mcollective-with-chef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article aimed at CIO&amp;rsquo;s and business folk on bridging the dev and
ops divide. It breaks things down to six elements, which really all come
down to improving collaboration, communication and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cio.com/article/688026/How_To_Improve_Collaboration_with_Development_and_Operations&quot;&gt;http://www.cio.com/article/688026/How_To_Improve_Collaboration_with_Development_and_Operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cox Media Group is looking for a passionate senior engineer who wants a
large role in architecting and implementing our continuous deployment
process. We&amp;rsquo;re using Python, Django, Git, Puppet, Postgres and RabbitMQ
to build out one of the largest media platforms for more than 120 sites.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got the backing of a billion dollar company, but the freedom and
flexibility to move fast and break new ground. We&amp;rsquo;re located in Atlanta,
GA but teleworking is an option for the right candidates. If this sounds
appealing or you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more contact &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#x61;&amp;#105;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#106;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x68;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#121;&amp;#46;&amp;#112;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#121;&amp;#x65;&amp;#114;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#x78;&amp;#105;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x63;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#x6d;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x6a;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x68;&amp;#110;&amp;#110;&amp;#x79;&amp;#46;&amp;#112;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x79;&amp;#101;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#x78;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x63;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pencil is a dashboard building tool for use with Graphite. I
particularly like the idea of being able to turn a relative timeslice
(say the last 8 hours) into an absolute one for placing a URL in bug
reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fetep/pencil&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fetep/pencil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lint tools can be really handy, both when learning a new language and
especially when refactoring. So it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see a lint tool for puppet
being worked on. It would be nice to see some documentation and details
of what it&amp;rsquo;s checking but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that will come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 34 &amp;ndash; 15th August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the good fortune this week of speaking to a room filled with
developers at the London Ruby User Group. What struck me was that lots
of people have yet to join the discussion around devops tools and ideas,
and at the same time lots of people are very interested. Hopefully a few
of those folks are reading this this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I forgot to mention the addition of encrypted data bags to Chef
when they were released. To make up for that omission here&amp;rsquo;s a nice
worked example of using the new feature to prevent you storing a
cleartext password in your recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/64227128&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/64227128&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix have written a little about their build pipeline, which is based
around creating custom AMI&amp;rsquo;s for deployment on EC2. They prevent any and
all changes to these images once mastered, which prevents any changes to
configuration later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/08/building-with-legos.html&quot;&gt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/08/building-with-legos.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice folks at Forward have started posting videos of some of their
internal tech talks, including this one about autoscaling with Puppet by
Ryan Conway. It&amp;rsquo;s just ten minutes long so worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/27335693&quot;&gt;http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/27335693&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent London Ruby User Group took on a bit of a devops feel, with
presentations about Puppet and one about Vagrant, Chef and local
development environments from myself. Skills Matter who kindly provide
the venue had videos of the talks up the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skillsmatter.com/event/home/lrug-puppet&quot;&gt;http://skillsmatter.com/event/home/lrug-puppet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent presentation by Patrick Debois and Julian Simpson covering all
things infrastructure as code. It dives into creating base boxes for
vagrant, using mccloud to fire up EC2 instances and shows examples of
using Cucumber-Nagios for alerting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/continuous-integration-for-the-world-infrastructure-as-code&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/continuous-integration-for-the-world-infrastructure-as-code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting ideas talking the technical dept ideas popular when
discussing agile software delivery and applying them to the types of
problem devops techniques aim to solve. The idea of using this when
trying to get buy-in to projects sounds a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/8/9/devops-and-technical-debt-a-debt-crisis-in-your-workplace.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/8/9/devops-and-technical-debt-a-debt-crisis-in-your-workplace.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chef 0.10.4 is out, and looks to be a must have release for anyone
running Redhat based distributions. Lots of bug fixes and lots more
performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/08/11/chef-0-10-4-released/&quot;&gt;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/08/11/chef-0-10-4-released/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capistrano is a great tool, but once you have more than a few hosts the
configuration can get out of hand &amp;ndash; especially if it&amp;rsquo;s duplicating that
already stored in Chef or Puppet or similar. Capistano-Cobbler is a tool
which can extract the required host information from a Cobbler server,
meaning less duplication and more dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/proffalken/capistrano-cobbler&quot;&gt;https://github.com/proffalken/capistrano-cobbler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your source control system has lots of interesting information locked up
in it&amp;rsquo;s meta data, and Metior looks an interesting tool for extracting
some of that if you&amp;rsquo;re using Git. It provides a Ruby library for
generating reports and accessing quite fine grained metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 33 &amp;ndash; 7th August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a quick break from the news and releases, I have to give special
mention this week to John Willis for his latest addition to the music of
devops: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebIr4F-vjQ.&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebIr4F-vjQ.&lt;/a&gt; Right, on with the
regular programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the abstracts for PuppetConf have been released. I&amp;rsquo;m
particularly looking forward to the Noah talk, and some of the notes on
Luke Kanies' keynote sound interesting; a move into application
management and how puppet can be smaller, faster, and easier to
integrate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetconf.com/speakers/&quot;&gt;http://puppetconf.com/speakers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience with Chef has been that you really only get the benefits
if you understand all the different moving parts and how they tie
together. I came across a useful representation of this architecture on
the much improved Chef wiki this week, specifically everything mapped
out using UML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Concepts+as+UML&quot;&gt;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Concepts+as+UML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m guessing most of the readers of this newsletter spend a lot of their
time on the command line. So I&amp;rsquo;m always happy when I find people talking
about user interface issues and design guidelines for command line
applications. Next time you&amp;rsquo;re building a little application try and
remember some of the guidelines on this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antoarts.com/designing-command-line-interfaces/&quot;&gt;http://www.antoarts.com/designing-command-line-interfaces/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to see what technologies and movements other
people find interesting, and the Thoughworks technology radar is a nice
example. Infrastructure as code, Continuous deployment and Devops ideas
feature prominently alongside lots of other things I&amp;rsquo;m fond of that I
want to see more people using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoughtworks.com/articles/technology-radar-july-2011&quot;&gt;http://www.thoughtworks.com/articles/technology-radar-july-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good argument that reaching some areas of the wider systems
administration ecosystem with devops ideas might be much harder that you
might think. The reluctance for some to write code in any form is
pointed out, as is the scarcity of people who make good systems
programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.citrix.com/2011/07/29/the-reluctance-to-code-is-devops-doomed/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.citrix.com/2011/07/29/the-reluctance-to-code-is-devops-doomed/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of Polyglot programmers has been popular for a while, with more
new languages seemingly becoming popular overnight. This post from
Heroku talks about what that means for your typical deployment and
operating infrastructure. The table comparing different languages and
the duplication of tools is interesting, as is the call for more
language-neutral interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/3/polyglot_platform/&quot;&gt;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/3/polyglot_platform/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the face of it EC2 reserved instances look like a great way of
reducing the cost of running in EC2. This post however argues that a
hidden cost of reserved instances is the lack of flexibility. If you&amp;rsquo;re
just using EC2 to bring up a relatively stable number and type of
instance then reserved instances can work but you&amp;rsquo;re not getting the
full benefit of the cloud environment. If your cluster is much more
dynamic then reserved instances might not save you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/03/31/why-amazon-reserve-instances-torment-me/&quot;&gt;http://theagileadmin.com/2011/03/31/why-amazon-reserve-instances-torment-me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hour long video from Damon Edwards talking devops and system
architecture with Ernest Mueller and Peco Karayanev of National
Instruments. It should be particularly interesting to anyone working
inside a large organisation as lots of the conversation is about how to
make positive changes and get everyone involved in delivery and
operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/7/12/devops-in-the-enterprise-whiteboard-session-at-national-inst.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/7/12/devops-in-the-enterprise-whiteboard-session-at-national-inst.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in the fight between continuous integration and
feature branches. It feels to me that we need more discussion from both
sides on this issue, partly because I see the same thing pointed out in
the Thoughtworks technology radar &amp;ndash; that as developers we&amp;rsquo;re branching
and merging more because the latest tools make it easy to do so. Martin
Fowlers piece on one of the problems with a branch heavy approach makes
interesting reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticConflict.html&quot;&gt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticConflict.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrenza need some help with the Sport Relief 2012 platform build, and
are looking for contract or permanent Chef lovers.
&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#105;&amp;#119;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#119;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x72;&amp;#107;&amp;#64;&amp;#99;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x72;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#122;&amp;#97;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#99;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&quot;&gt;&amp;#105;&amp;#x77;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#x74;&amp;#116;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x77;&amp;#111;&amp;#x72;&amp;#107;&amp;#64;&amp;#x63;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#110;&amp;#122;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#99;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling charitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This section is sponsored, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in featuring a job get
in touch at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#97;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#x67;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x68;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x68;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x73;&amp;#101;&amp;#x76;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x74;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x67;&amp;#x61;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#x76;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#46;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x65;&amp;#116;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of writing tests for configuration management tools is talked
about a lot, and chef spec looks an interesting approach if you&amp;rsquo;re using
Chef. For a new project the documentation is also great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acrmp.github.com/chefspec/&quot;&gt;http://acrmp.github.com/chefspec/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porkshop describes itself as a simple network-based system information
server. Install it on your servers and it exposes information about the
host over a simple HTTP interface. Plugins look simple enough to write
too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/disqus/porkchop&quot;&gt;https://github.com/disqus/porkchop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bunraku is a simple status panel for puppet, hooking into the puppet
reporting facility and storing information in Redis. It&amp;rsquo;s also looks
like it would make a good starting point if you wanted to build you&amp;rsquo;re
own report processing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 32 &amp;#8211; 31st July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A busy week for content, only partly down to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OSCON&lt;/span&gt; it seems. Hopefully you&amp;#8217;ll have time to read a selection of introductions, delve into a few publicly available Puppet and Chef repositories and add a few new tools to your toolbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fantastic article by Mathias Meyer entitled Web Operations 101 For Developers. It really is a great introduction to operations and associated concerns from those coming from a development background. Definitely worth circulating amongst your work colleagues whichever side of the tracks you&amp;#8217;re from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/7/25/web_operations_101_for_developers.html&quot;&gt;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/7/25/web_operations_101_for_developers.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more tools are coming with rich API&amp;#8217;s, often exposing data as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;. Familiar tools like grep can be used on this data but in a fairly brute force way, they have no understanding of the overall document structure. That&amp;#8217;s where jgrep from Pieter Loubser comes in. Here&amp;#8217;s some useful examples from R.I. Pienaar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/07/29/rich-data-on-the-cli.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/07/29/rich-data-on-the-cli.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like Ben Rockwood has stumbled upon a treasure trove of useful reading material for anyone interested in the management/process side of devops. A fantastic post for anyone in search of a solid list of book recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cuddletech.com/blog/?p=642&quot;&gt;http://cuddletech.com/blog/?p=642&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning a new tool it&amp;#8217;s often useful to see more than just simple examples, and be able to explore an entire project. Open source is generally very good at libraries, examples and tools, less so on entire working code bases. So I enjoyed looking through the a Chef repository in use at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CERN&lt;/span&gt; and the Debian project puppet repo this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.hep.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;http://code.hep.wisc.edu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=mirror/dsa-puppet.git;a=summary&quot;&gt;http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=mirror/dsa-puppet.git;a=summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to forget that the Vagrant configuration file is just Ruby, which means you can do some quite simple optimisations for multi-box environments. This Gist shows a quick example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1108747&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/1108747&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great talk from Jordan Sissel at Oscon on Logstash and where it&amp;#8217;s aiming to fit into the whole logging puzzle. The slides themselves are worth going through anyway, but you can also get the speakers notes (from the actions button at the bottom) which give more background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfNjV3bXFnNHNnbQ&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;pli=1&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfNjV3bXFnNHNnbQ&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;pli=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another What is Devops post, but one that acts as a bit of a history up till now for those that are just hearing about the term. It&amp;#8217;s also nicely written and balanced, mentioning both positive and negative points, all in a very readable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev-spout.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-is-devops.html&quot;&gt;http://dev-spout.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-is-devops.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Joel Test is well known amongst developers as an opinionated but useful quick look at what you can improve across a software team. Thomas Limoncelli has just published a similar list of systems administration. It comprises 32 questions (which is probably a few too many to be quick in my opinion) that you can use to pin point areas to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/the-test.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/the-test.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly what your configuration management tool should manage has been a hot topic of late, with several good discussions that I&amp;#8217;m aware of about packages vs configuration. This article from Sean OMeara explains the approach he prefers, which I thought was neatly summed up by &amp;#8220;Don’t edit config files. Instead, edit the truth.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/8140290279/configuration-management-strategies&quot;&gt;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/8140290279/configuration-management-strategies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A worthwhile article that talks about the different audiences for packaging, praising both apt for its features and tools like Leiningen for solving developers problems. Leiningen is a clojure tool similar in purpose to Bundler, and interestingly it&amp;#8217;s in the process of being packaged for Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technomancy.us/151&quot;&gt;http://technomancy.us/151&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabled deployinator, Etsy&amp;#8217;s inhouse deployment tool, has been open sourced as mentioned last week. The code is on GitHub and more documentation is being added all the time. I&amp;#8217;d love someone to write up experiences of getting this up and running and where they see it fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/deployinator&quot;&gt;https://github.com/etsy/deployinator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell have open sourced a tool they have been using to bring up a multi-node OpenStack cloud on bare metal. It appears to use Chef under the hood. Worth a look if you&amp;#8217;re wanting to investigate OpenStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bartongeorge.net/2011/07/26/dell-announces-availability-of-openstack-solution-open-sources-crowbar-software-framework/&quot;&gt;http://bartongeorge.net/2011/07/26/dell-announces-availability-of-openstack-solution-open-sources-crowbar-software-framework/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 31 &amp;#8211; 24th July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This issue is dedicated to all those who call themselves system administrators, because this Friday it&amp;#8217;s System Administrator Appreciation Day http://sysadminday.com/. Devops is all about communication so if you&amp;#8217;re not already best friends with your sysadmin colleagues go strike up a conversation this week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Debois gave what looks to have been a fantastic presentation at devopsdownunder last week. Devops, what&amp;#8217;s in a word?, counters in plain terms all the arguments against devops in one slide deck. This will probably become my reference when I have those tricky conversations about why I find the devops movement interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devopsdays-downundervfinal&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devopsdays-downundervfinal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #monitoringsucks &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; chat happened last week, and John has written up the notes. It turns out naming things is hard, but the post is a good start, and mapping these terms to existing tools is a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/07/monitoring-sucks-watch-your-language.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/07/monitoring-sucks-watch-your-language.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Allspaw appears to spend his time reading some rather interesting material. Here&amp;#8217;s a section taken from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Systems Engineering handbook, which describes rather brilliantly what a systems engineer is. I&amp;#8217;m sure lots of people will look at this and find it a pretty good description of what they do with software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/07/18/systems-engineering-great-definition/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/07/18/systems-engineering-great-definition/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When identifying what&amp;#8217;s causing your web application to perform badly, it&amp;#8217;s often the database that&amp;#8217;s the first to be blamed. This article covers why this is and some of the things you can do to help diagnose the actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appdynamics.com/blog/2011/07/12/slow-sql-a-usual-suspect/&quot;&gt;http://www.appdynamics.com/blog/2011/07/12/slow-sql-a-usual-suspect/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m quite a fan of High Scalability posts, especially those that are basically lists of interesting facts about a companies architecture. New Relic reveal all sorts of interesting facts, in particular about how they deal with the database side of such a write heavy application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/7/18/new-relic-architecture-collecting-20-billion-metrics-a-day.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/7/18/new-relic-architecture-collecting-20-billion-metrics-a-day.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix have previously written about the Chaos Monkey, a tool for keeping them honest when it comes to cloud redundancy. They have been taking this approach further, with tools introducing latency, taking down entire availability zones and checking security and conformance criteria. I&amp;#8217;d love to see some of these open sourced eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice details writeup and presentation of using a Kanban system in an operations team. This post covers what the team at realestate.com.au have learned, and includes lots of photos that really help make sense of the system they adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Velocity Conference is set to hit Europe, specifically Berlin on 8th and 9th of November. The Call for Papers is out now, you have until the 8th of August to get your talk ideas submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu/&quot;&gt;http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is spawning more plugins as well, I came across vagrant-hosts this week that automatically add or remove local hosts entries when bringing up or shutting down machines with vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dwt/vagrant-hosts&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dwt/vagrant-hosts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re looking for a web based application to manage your virtual machines, then Archipel might be of interest. It uses an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XMPP&lt;/span&gt; daemon installed on each machine for communication and supports everything via libvert. It&amp;#8217;s open source as too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archipelproject.org/&quot;&gt;http://archipelproject.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dew is an environment management tool intended for use in multi-instance &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; application deployments. It takes a single configuration file and provides commands to create and manage a number of newly created instances in a similar way to Amazon&amp;#8217;s own CloudFormation. I&amp;#8217;d love to see a bit more documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/playup/dew&quot;&gt;https://github.com/playup/dew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etsy have released the tools they use for AB testing, multivariate testing and various other flavours of experimental feature release. It&amp;#8217;s a collection of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; classes, but I would love to see implementations in other languages and frameworks. Looks like Etsy are also planning on open sourcing deployinator at some point too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 30 &amp;#8211; 17th July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to lots of new readers this week. More new readers in fact that any other week since the first. Hopefully the collection of tools and news will prove useful. And if anyone has any good links do let me know at gareth@morethanseven.net&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John E. Vincent has continued driving the #monitoringsucks discussion, and is organising another &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; chat. This time it&amp;#8217;s likely to be more focused on producing things that help with any resulting hacking. After a quick vote the chat has been organised for Thursday, July 21st at 5:00 PM &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt; so should be good for those in the US and Europe hopefully. A further chat for those closer to Australia who will likely be asleep is in the works too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/07/monitoring-sucks-round-2-fight.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/07/monitoring-sucks-round-2-fight.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Ray has taken a look at the terminology around discussing monitoring. Agreeing on words and concepts will be pretty important if the whole #monitoringsucks explosion of compatible tools and services is to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leastresistance.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/monitoringsucks-terminology-first-stab/&quot;&gt;https://leastresistance.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/monitoringsucks-terminology-first-stab/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been doing more with Jenkins again recently and came across the excellent Build Pipeline plugin. If you&amp;#8217;ve read the Continuous Delivery book you&amp;#8217;ll be familiar with the term, but at a basic level it&amp;#8217;s using downstream builds to define a deployment workflow. With the plugin you get a very nice visualisation and importantly the ability to introduce manual gates (for instance for a QA check on staging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Pipeline+Plugin&quot;&gt;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JENKINS&lt;/span&gt;/Build+Pipeline+Plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.knuthaugen.no/2011/04/continuous-delivery-the-ruby-way.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.knuthaugen.no/2011/04/continuous-delivery-the-ruby-way.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multunus.com/2011/07/continuous-delivery-using-jenkins-build-pipeline/&quot;&gt;http://www.multunus.com/2011/07/continuous-delivery-using-jenkins-build-pipeline/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid evolution of career paths is an interesting aside to the growth of devops, but where are the next generation going to come from. A nice post enthusing about the role of the system administrator, why you might want to be one, and how you can get started. I think personally I&amp;#8217;d have added something about learning to programme as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://silverwraith.com/blog/2011/07/so-you-want-to-be-a-systems-administrator/&quot;&gt;http://silverwraith.com/blog/2011/07/so-you-want-to-be-a-systems-administrator/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monitoring discussions this week prompted me to look around for other new contenders, and I found Critical from Dan DeLeo of Opscode. It features a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt; for describing metrics and the monitoring of those metrics. Definitely worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielsdeleo/critical&quot;&gt;https://github.com/danielsdeleo/critical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more folks are using Graphite it seems for storing ad-hoc metrics data. Diamond is a python based daemon for collecting and publishing metrics including cpu, memory, network, i/o, load and disk data. It also has a simple &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for more custom data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.brightcove.com/project/Diamond/&quot;&gt;http://opensource.brightcove.com/project/Diamond/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you get more data into Graphite you might want to alert on it from Nagios. Very similar to the check_ganglia command, check_graphite is a Nagios plugin that takes an average data point from graphite and compares it to a threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 29 &amp;#8211; 10th July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slightly quieter week this time, which probably means lots of people are off enjoying a much needed holiday. Hopefully with all that free time readers are plotting even more tools and blog posts right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glu is the deployment framework open sourced by LinkedIn, and this video of its creator Yan Pujante talking at a Chicago DevOps event is worth watching. Good demo explaining where it fits in and some good insights into the scale at which LinkedIn are working at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/07/09/glu-deployment-automation-video/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/07/09/glu-deployment-automation-video/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#8217;re deploying more often we&amp;#8217;re probably generating more and more deployment artefacts. The question then is how long to store them? This article by Dave Farley goes into the different types of artefacts we&amp;#8217;re creating and what we might want to keep around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agile.dzone.com/news/how-long-retain-build-output&quot;&gt;http://agile.dzone.com/news/how-long-retain-build-output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikolay Sturm has recently started a new job, and is documenting the context surrounding man of the emerging devops best practices we hear lots about. So far covering branching and configuration management, with hopefully more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nistu.de/tags/devops%20toolbox/&quot;&gt;http://blog.nistu.de/tags/devops%20toolbox/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice viewpoint from Philip J. Hollenback on devops. In particular coming to the term via the tools and later realising that it&amp;#8217;s really more about people and working together. Or more specifically DevOps Means Don&amp;#8217;t Be an A-hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/DevOpsMeansDontBeAnAhole&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/DevOpsMeansDontBeAnAhole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is using Chef or Puppet for managing configuration files on a number of servers. WooMe take nearly the opposite approach, configuring the individual boxes, storing those files in mercurial repositories and then aggregating all those repos and the changes to a central machine for viewing as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://making.dev.woome.com/post/7299452441/lazy-devops-config-recoverability-with-mercurial&quot;&gt;http://making.dev.woome.com/post/7299452441/lazy-devops-config-recoverability-with-mercurial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s commonly held that we need new approaches to monitoring, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSAC&lt;/span&gt; is Dean Wilson&amp;#8217;s take on the subject. At the moment we have high level diagrams of how a monitoring system could work, with code coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/introduction-to-dsac.html&quot;&gt;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/introduction-to-dsac.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks are hacking on new approaches to monitoring it seems. As predominantly a developer I personally quite like the idea of checks as unit tests, and PagerUnit from Richard Crowley takes that approach. Write some python tests, and have PagerUnit run them every 10 seconds and email you if they fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rcrowley/pagerunit&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rcrowley/pagerunit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tool from Richard is python-cloudformation, a python library for creating &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; CloudFormation templates. Not much documentation yet but see the linked example for an idea of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/devstructure/python-cloudformation&quot;&gt;https://github.com/devstructure/python-cloudformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeolus is a tool from RedHat designed to easy managing cloud instances or virtual machines across different internal and external providers. It provides a browser based dashboard for firing up and managing new machines. With support for Eucalyptus, VMware vSphere, Rackspace, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; and more it might be useful for some folks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 28 &amp;#8211; 3rd July 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lots of events news this week, along with a load of videos from various recent events. I&amp;#8217;ll be at the next London Devops event and in Goteburg later in the year, hopefully see a few people at both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration is now open for Devops Days Europe in Goteborg. $120 for 2 days is great value, and with only 150 people attending it should be quite a good event for indepth discussions. See you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/registration/&quot;&gt;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/registration/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next London Devops event is now open for signup. The event is free to attend and will be on the 25th July 2011. The nice folks at Forward are sponsoring and providing a really nice space. If you&amp;#8217;re in London do come along. We&amp;#8217;re still looking for more speakers so if you&amp;#8217;re interested get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://londondevops.eventwax.com/devops-talks-back&quot;&gt;https://londondevops.eventwax.com/devops-talks-back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos from sessions at Devops Days Mountain View have been posted online. Talks and discussions on Kanban, QA, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; Caching, Orchestration and more. Lots to catch up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/tag/devops-days-mv-2011-video&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/tag/devops-days-mv-2011-video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finding more and more videos with great content recently, including this talk from QCon by Jez Humble on minimising risk when releasing software. Worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Remediation-Patterns&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Remediation-Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More videos from Damon Edwards, this time two videos from a visit to Etsy and discussions with John Allspaw. Two quick videos discussing metrics and what to put on developer and operations dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/6/24/video-with-john-allspaw-at-etsy-what-to-put-on-the-big-dashb.html&quot;&gt;http://dev2ops.org/blog/2011/6/24/video-with-john-allspaw-at-etsy-what-to-put-on-the-big-dashb.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent Heroku release packed in lots of improvements and changes, and this series on some of the underlying principles has been great. This article goes over what they describe as Erosion Resistance of a platform, basically knowing if it works today that it will still work in the future without excessive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/6/28/the_new_heroku_4_erosion_resistance_explicit_contracts/&quot;&gt;http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/6/28/the_new_heroku_4_erosion_resistance_explicit_contracts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice article from Ben Rockwood on what he describes as the Three Aspects of DevOps. Breaking the adoption of Devops practices into three phases, with activities under each is a nice high level way of looking for the next step in your team or organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cuddletech.com/blog/?p=624&quot;&gt;http://cuddletech.com/blog/?p=624&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice article by Brian Henerey from Sony on building a new team within the Online Technology Group. Some good tips for anyone involved in hiring and building or improving a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilesysadmin.net/building-a-devops-team&quot;&gt;http://agilesysadmin.net/building-a-devops-team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever building a system it&amp;#8217;s interesting to be able to compare with other similar platforms. Most individuals only have so much experience, so it&amp;#8217;s always nice to see details like these from TripAdvisor published online. Everything from number of service requests, expected response times, size of logs, etc. Lots to dig into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/6/27/tripadvisor-architecture-40m-visitors-200m-dynamic-page-view.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/6/27/tripadvisor-architecture-40m-visitors-200m-dynamic-page-view.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating custom AMIs for EC2 has generally been something I&amp;#8217;ve avoided, but Stem looks an incredibly simply way of creating and launching custom AMIs. A simple command line tool with a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; configuration file. If you&amp;#8217;re using EC2 well worth taking a look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelgorsuch.com/2011/02/27/introduction-to-stem.html&quot;&gt;http://michaelgorsuch.com/2011/02/27/introduction-to-stem.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started with configuration management across a number of machines often requires a bit of setting things up and maybe some money spend on EC2. Chef Box is an interesting project that provides tools for bringing up several Vagrant controlled Ubuntu machines on your desktop, all managed by an Chef server installed on one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 27 - 26th June 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/06/26/issue-27/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 27 &amp;#8211; 26th June 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure more people are writing more about devops and related topics each week. Either that or I&amp;#8217;m finding more articles each week. Either way here&amp;#8217;s a whole bunch of videos, articles, slide-desks and tools from the last week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of devopsdays in the US, the call for papers has gone out for the upcoming European event in Gothenburg. The theme this year is all about &amp;#8216;inclusive&amp;#8217;, so hopefully lots more talk about the people side of devops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/proposals/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/proposals/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whopping 247 slide desk from John Allspaw presented at Velocity a few weeks ago titled Advanced PostMortem Fu and Human Error 101. Well worth a look, I&amp;#8217;m just hoping the video of this talk makes it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/advanced-postmortem-fu-and-human-error-101-velocity-2011&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/advanced-postmortem-fu-and-human-error-101-velocity-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick gave what looks to have been an excellent talk at devopsdats about where Vagrant fits into a typical development workflow. Well worth a skim through if you&amp;#8217;re not sure yet how local virtualisation tools actually help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/vagrant-devopsdays-mountain-view-2011&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/vagrant-devopsdays-mountain-view-2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as slides many of the keynote talks from Velocity are already up for viewing. That&amp;#8217;s a whole 6 hours of video that should keep anyone busy who couldn&amp;#8217;t make it along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=C394849408B5F203&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=C394849408B5F203&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; to download and print from Paul Duvall and DZone focusing on Continuous Delivery. It pulls out lots of the component parts and outlines patterns and anti-patterns that you can strive for or look to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/continuous-delivery-patterns&quot;&gt;http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/continuous-delivery-patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very thorough writeup of an operational problem, from detection through diagnosis and onwards to resolution and root cause analysis. It&amp;#8217;s always illuminating when people go into the details behind even small problems like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omniti.com/seeds/when-things-go-wrong-a-case-study&quot;&gt;http://omniti.com/seeds/when-things-go-wrong-a-case-study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heals of last weeks big Ganglia UI release, Vladimir Vuksan has pushed another super useful feature called Overlay Events. Simply put you can mark events (like deploys or backups) on your graphs when they happen using a simple http based &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Very useful for diagnosing why a metric has just gone haywire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ganglia.info/?p=382&quot;&gt;http://ganglia.info/?p=382&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Newman from Thoughtworks gave a talk at a recent quarterly briefing about DevOps and Continuous Delivery (hit the watch the full briefing button near the top right for the full video).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/push-the-button&quot;&gt;http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/push-the-button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full day free event on OpenStack is happening in London on Jul 13th. Introductory talks, panels and some technical sessions in the afternoon. Looks like it might be worth heading along if you&amp;#8217;re in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emeaopenstackday.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;http://emeaopenstackday.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup from velocity and in particular devopsdays US. Several interesting discussions keep being mentioned by folks who went along, hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll find some more write-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appdynamics.com/blog/2011/06/22/web-ops-to-dev-ops-in-mountain-view/&quot;&gt;http://www.appdynamics.com/blog/2011/06/22/web-ops-to-dev-ops-in-mountain-view/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London CI meetup has been excellent when I&amp;#8217;ve managed to get along, and it&amp;#8217;s always nice when people write up the events afterwards. The last event had Gus Power talking about Continuous Integration, in particular focusing on measuring system acceptance criteria which are often missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesbetteley.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/continuous-integration-the-last-mile/&quot;&gt;http://jamesbetteley.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/continuous-integration-the-last-mile/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet 2.7.0 has been released, including deterministic catalog application, a newly apache licenced codebase, support for Ruby 1.9.2 and the new Puppet Faces &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Well worth upgrading if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/puppet-users/browse_thread/thread/ffe1345c165bf293?pli=1&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/puppet-users/browse_thread/thread/ffe1345c165bf293?pli=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing configuration management code is often discussed but I think it&amp;#8217;s fair to say no one approach or tool has yet won widespread adoption. Chefci looks interesting however, more as one potential approach at this stage. It focuses on solving a specific problem of a development based OS X workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry for the slight delay this week, I&amp;#8217;m just moving into a rather nice new house and hence rather busy. To make up for that this weeks issue is rather jam-packed with interesting content. And I haven&amp;#8217;t even caught up with anything that&amp;#8217;s come out of velocity or devopsdays yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet have announced PuppetConf, a pretty amazing looking multi-track operations conference in Portland from September 19th-23rd. I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited to have been asked to be Master Of Ceremonies for the Devops track, so hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll see a few of you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://puppetconf.com/&quot;&gt;http://puppetconf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new book by Noah Campbell looks interesting, aiming to cover everything about Yum and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; from a clear introduction to using it for application deployment. Three chapters are available to read online so far in draft format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webscalebook.com/&quot;&gt;http://webscalebook.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good overview of how one organisation is currently deploying software. I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of information like this being shared, it gives people lots more chances to learn and to critique others approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperatiOns.com/state-of-development-annual-address-on-how-we-ship-software&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperatiOns.com/state-of-development-annual-address-on-how-we-ship-software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maven might not be everyones favourite tool but it&amp;#8217;s pretty powerful. With that comes complexity, and this book, published on GitHub, looks a nice way of learning the ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buildndeploy/maven-book&quot;&gt;https://github.com/buildndeploy/maven-book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d missed the new relationship syntax in Puppet, but this article shows why it&amp;#8217;s super useful with the example of wanting to run an apt-get update before installing a package. Quick talk of other approaches and then code showing how the relationship approach solves the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://johnleach.co.uk/words/771/puppet-dependencies-and-run-stages&quot;&gt;http://johnleach.co.uk/words/771/puppet-dependencies-and-run-stages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those nice folk at Devstructure would like to show more people how powerful their blueprint tool is. So they are offering to build blueprints for people that contact them with specific architecture problems. I&amp;#8217;d love to see some of the resulting blueprints open sourced so we can all learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.devstructure.com/two-men-and-a-server&quot;&gt;http://blog.devstructure.com/two-men-and-a-server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chef isn&amp;#8217;t just for managing lots of servers, and Joshua&amp;#8217;s latest post shows how he&amp;#8217;s using it to manage his OS X home machines. Some interesting generic recipes referenced that will be useful the next time I manage to get myself a new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/managing-my-workstations-with-chef&quot;&gt;http://jtimberman.posterous.com/managing-my-workstations-with-chef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid using the term &amp;#8220;Cloud Computing&amp;#8221; except when being ironic says this post, or rather it points out that for technical discussions we should be more specific about what we mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/06/avoid-using-the-term-cloud-com.html&quot;&gt;http://everythingsysadmin.com/2011/06/avoid-using-the-term-cloud-com.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how Google go about continuous integration? This post has lots of interesting details about the approach they take to deal with a large volatile codebase. The short version is that they use a dependency graph to only run the tests relevant to the change at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/06/testing-at-speed-and-scale-of-google.html&quot;&gt;http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/06/testing-at-speed-and-scale-of-google.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet will happily watch the status of running services, but under the hood it turns out that it often just does that by looking at the low level process. Dean Wilson points out how to have it use the operating system process management tool, as well as how to write custom checks for even better monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/puppet/smarter-service-status-in-puppet.html&quot;&gt;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/puppet/smarter-service-status-in-puppet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysing log files is fun. But the bigger the log files get the harder the problem becomes, unless you&amp;#8217;re already using something like Hadoop. This article from Troy Davis of PaperTrail shows you how to use Amazon&amp;#8217;s hosted Hadoop and Hive system to analyse logs from S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/analytics/log-analytics-with-hadoop-and-hive&quot;&gt;http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/analytics/log-analytics-with-hadoop-and-hive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganglia Web 2.0 has been released, including the much more functional web front end. You can also now define graphs in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; as well as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, send data easily to Graphite, dynamically build aggregate graphs and access metric data as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ganglia.info/?p=393&quot;&gt;http://ganglia.info/?p=393&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another release from an establish project, the Go release management tool from Thoughtworks Studios has released version 2.2. This release introduces better tools for managing and comparing release pipelines as well as versioning all configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://community.thoughtworks.com/posts/7dcda4ede1&quot;&gt;http://community.thoughtworks.com/posts/7dcda4ede1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misty is a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt; for Amazon&amp;#8217;s Cloud Formation tool from the developers at Forward. It allows you to describe an architecture of EC2 instances and have them come up when commanded. No documentation yet but the example Mistfile from the tests looks interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 25 &amp;#8211; 11th June 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Velocity and devopsdays next week and I&amp;#8217;m guessing a fair few readers will be going along. While you&amp;#8217;re enjoying all the glorious content take a moment to think of everyone who can&amp;#8217;t make it &amp;#8211; and blog and tweet like crazy so we can keep up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out Puppet Labs employ a User Experience Designer, responsible for making the command line, API&amp;#8217;s and the Puppet &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt; as nice to use as they can be. Too many designers miss the potential of command line utilities so this is greta news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/what-is-user-experience-in-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/what-is-user-experience-in-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.I.Pienaar (of mcollective fame) has been very busy this last week. First releasing Hiera, a new hierarchal data store aimed at representing key value data about infrastructure. The following two blog posts go into details about how this can be used with puppet to keep manifests particularly clean and reusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/05/hiera_a_pluggable_hierarchical_data_store.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/05/hiera_a_pluggable_hierarchical_data_store.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned the growing #monitoringsucks movement in the last few issues. John Vincent has written a good blog post summarising what&amp;#8217;s going on and what he&amp;#8217;d love to see come out of the group. The project now has repos for tools, metrics best practice, irc logs and any blog posts written on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-monitoring-sucks.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-monitoring-sucks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium is a handy tool, but running it in headless mode has often been troublesome. This blog post demonstrates using PyVirtualDisplay, a Python wrapper for Xvfb and Xephyr, to run your tests. If you&amp;#8217;re using Python this looks very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2011/06/python-headless-selenium-webdriver.html&quot;&gt;http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2011/06/python-headless-selenium-webdriver.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this article on the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; Integrated Service Management Blog. Describing devops as &amp;#8220;simultaneously reassuring and terrifying&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s a really interesting, and positive, insight from an experienced outsider. The car analogy is a nice thought as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/59c1123b-0353-458e-a719-b002d84108d5/entry/devops_should_i_have_known_what_that_is1?lang=en_us&quot;&gt;https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/59c1123b-0353-458e-a719-b002d84108d5/entry/devops_should_i_have_known_what_that_is1?lang=en_us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log.io looks an interesting tool for visualising log files in realtime in a browser. It&amp;#8217;s a node.js application that you can host yourself, and it can harvest log files from multiple machines and let you build up views of what you want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://logio.org/&quot;&gt;http://logio.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagrant is spawning a number of useful plugins, and snap is the latest. It provides the ability to take snapshots of virtual machines and then restore back to them, and it usefully supports multi-vm vagrantfiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/t9md/vagrant-snap&quot;&gt;https://github.com/t9md/vagrant-snap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chef.vim is plugin for vim using chef fans. It provides the ability to jump between attributes and recipes and easily open recipes, templates and files in your cookbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/t9md/vim-chef&quot;&gt;https://github.com/t9md/vim-chef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 24 &amp;#8211; 4th June 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tell it&amp;#8217;s the summer because of all the conferences it seems. Lots of events are happening around Velocity this year, as well as Devops Down Under in Australia next month. Hopefully that means lots of videos and content for the weeks following those events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Devops Down Under event is now open for registration. It&amp;#8217;s a two day event with scheduled talks and open spaces and is talking place on July 22nd and 23rd in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdownunder.org/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdownunder.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Devops Cafe podcast made a comeback last week and it sounds like it&amp;#8217;s going to be back to being a regular show. This episode features a good discussion with John Vincent about devops in general and noah in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/6/2/episode-18.html&quot;&gt;http://devopscafe.org/show/2011/6/2/episode-18.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook have released a video talking about how the Release Engineering team push out changes to Facebook. Lots of interesting details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10100259101684977&amp;amp;oid=9445547199&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10100259101684977&amp;amp;oid=9445547199&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone enjoys managing a Ruby stack, and the recent changes in Rubygems 1.8 have caused people using operating system packaged versions of Ruby some problems. Slimgems is a new project which aims to maintain the old &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; at the same time as providing features and performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gnuu.org/2011/06/01/slimgems-a-drop-in-replacement-for-rubygems/&quot;&gt;http://gnuu.org/2011/06/01/slimgems-a-drop-in-replacement-for-rubygems/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice folks at Devstructure have released Blueprint I/O, a server that allows you to store blueprints in S3 and easily move them around between different servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.devstructure.com/blueprint-io&quot;&gt;http://blog.devstructure.com/blueprint-io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another event, this time in Sunnyvale on June 16th (just after velocity finishes). Following on from a previous night of talking monitoring, this time the same topic but with a ban on talking about Nagios. Sounds fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Area-Large-Scale-Production-Engineering/events/15481164/&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Area-Large-Scale-Production-Engineering/events/15481164/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohsuke Kawaguchi, the creator of Jenkins, was in London last week to do a talk and Maciej Matyjas wrote up a few notes. My favourite quote has to be &amp;#8220;Treat servers like livestock rather than pets&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://matyjas.posterous.com/distributed-builds-with-jenkins-jenkinsci&quot;&gt;http://matyjas.posterous.com/distributed-builds-with-jenkins-jenkinsci&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice comprehensive writeup from the team at Outbrain about monitoring. Contains lots of screen shots from their setup and links to the various tools they are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.outbrain.com/2011/05/monitoring-a-wild-beast/&quot;&gt;http://techblog.outbrain.com/2011/05/monitoring-a-wild-beast/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #monitoringsucks discussion has spawned a useful looking GitHub repo containing links to a large number of existing monitoring tools. Useful if you&amp;#8217;re looking for something specific or seeking inspiration for a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/monitoringsucks/tool-repos&quot;&gt;https://github.com/monitoringsucks/tool-repos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 23 &amp;#8211; 28th May 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another busy week on the internet, including a very interesting discussion about the state of monitoring on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; and twitter using the tag #monitoringsucks. For those who missed it (or like me where asleep because it was the middle of the night) the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; logs are available at https://github.com/monitoringsucks/irc-logs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good story based article from an experienced agile consultant about the often fraught relationship between development and operations groups. Has some interesting things she has tried to encourage better understanding and communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.estherderby.com/2011/03/bridging-structural-conflict-same-and-different.html&quot;&gt;http://www.estherderby.com/2011/03/bridging-structural-conflict-same-and-different.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surge conference on scalability and performance is on again in September, and to show folks what it&amp;#8217;s all about they have kindly released last years speakers videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omniti.com/surge/2010/speakers&quot;&gt;http://omniti.com/surge/2010/speakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroku suffered a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DDOS&lt;/span&gt; attack last week and, after dealing with it, posted some interesting findings and recommendations. In particular they recommend against using bare domain names, instead always using subdomains that can be &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; aliased to their proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://status.heroku.com/incident/156&quot;&gt;http://status.heroku.com/incident/156&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agile Cambridge conference has a call for speakers out until the June 17th, and are specifically looking for Devops flavoured talks. Promoting this is only slightly self-centred, I live in Cambridge and like the idea of interesting folk coming to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilecambridge.net/ac2011/speak.php&quot;&gt;http://www.agilecambridge.net/ac2011/speak.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having something to aim for when you&amp;#8217;re building anything is useful, and this sort list outlines 7 levels of continuous integration. Worthwhile thinking about where you sit and how to reach the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agile.dzone.com/news/7-levels-continuous&quot;&gt;http://agile.dzone.com/news/7-levels-continuous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well written article on common pitfalls when running &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; load tests, done as a set of 10 things you should think about and ideally be doing. Especially useful if you&amp;#8217;re just starting to look at load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/05/18/http_benchmark_rules&quot;&gt;http://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/05/18/http_benchmark_rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good walk-though with code examples for managing a puppet workflow with Capistrano. Featuring the ability to deploy and easily rollback changes to different environments and making use of mcollective to trigger puppet runs across all your machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.threedrunkensysadsonthe.net/2011/05/deploy-and-roll-back-system-configs-with-capistrano-mcollective-and-puppet/&quot;&gt;http://www.threedrunkensysadsonthe.net/2011/05/deploy-and-roll-back-system-configs-with-capistrano-mcollective-and-puppet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people seem to be intrigued with the possibilities of Noah, but most of the examples I&amp;#8217;ve seen have been using Chef. James Turnbull has been putting together some Puppet based examples, including one that queries a Noah server for a host and uses the list of its services to specify which Puppet classes to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kartar.net/2011/05/puppet-noah/&quot;&gt;http://www.kartar.net/2011/05/puppet-noah/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenStack folks have been building their own message queuing system called Burrow aimed at being used in a multi-tenant system. They do a pretty good job of outlining why they went down this route rather than using an existing product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://burrow.openstack.org/overview.html&quot;&gt;http://burrow.openstack.org/overview.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotspots is a very nice looking Rails profiling tool. Add some middleware to collect the data and then run the included command line tool to produce a very comprehensive report. I&amp;#8217;ve been using request_log_analyzer recently too, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see similar tools for other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tmm1/hotspots&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tmm1/hotspots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice blog post by a member of the Economist development team on how they are using Selenium to test code on every commit. In particular they have written a simple &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; application to help with creating a X virtual frame buffer and then using ffmpeg to capture a video of all the tests run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codebaboon.com/economist-testing-drupal-using-selenium&quot;&gt;http://codebaboon.com/economist-testing-drupal-using-selenium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More articles worth reading, events worth attending and tools worth investigating. If only I had time to try out all of the things everyone is publishing or discussing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Devopsdays Europe has a date, Friday 14th and Saturday 15th of October 2011, to go along with the location of Goteborg in Sweden. They are still looking for sponsors so if that&amp;#8217;s you be sure to get in touch with the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro Puppet is out. James Turnbull has written a follow up to the first Puppet book, this time with much more content and with an index (sorry James). It covers getting started all the way through to using MCollective. Apologies for the affiliate link, it helps pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1430230576/tag=devobook-21&quot;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1430230576/tag=devobook-21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; link I&amp;#8217;ve included I think, but it&amp;#8217;s worth it. The Operating Systems Division of The National Security Agency has published a whopping 200 page guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. If this is a topic you need to know about this looks perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to wager lots of readers spend a great deal of time in the console, and why not when so many powerful tools exist all just a keystroke away? This post is collecting useful command line tools, a few of which I&amp;#8217;d not come across before. Particularly good starting point if you&amp;#8217;re new to the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kkovacs.eu/cool-but-obscure-unix-tools&quot;&gt;http://kkovacs.eu/cool-but-obscure-unix-tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is probably vaguely (or intimately) familiar with the Unix Process model. Adam Wiggins of Heroku has been writing about applying this approach to web applications, in particular as an approach to scaling up a system. The tool mentioned called Foreman looks pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/5/9/applying_the_unix_process_model_to_web_apps/&quot;&gt;http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/5/9/applying_the_unix_process_model_to_web_apps/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice long form article by Jez Humble aimed at CIOs and technical managers. Introducing the ideas behind continuous delivery and other devops tenets, and focusing on the business rationale to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cioupdate.com/trends/article.php/3933106/Tired-of-Playing-Ping-Pong-with-Dev-QA-and-Ops.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.cioupdate.com/trends/article.php/3933106/Tired-of-Playing-Ping-Pong-with-Dev-QA-and-Ops.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice article arguing that, yes, adopting devops practices will probably lead to more work due to unfulfilled demand, but that this is a good thing. And with the right tools, people and processes in place should both drive down costs and drive up profits. Good examples to backup the theme too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-driven-demand&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-driven-demand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easier to build apps upon apps with advances in APIs and simpler to fire up new servers in cloud environments either inside or outside your company. This proliferation and speed makes traditional business continuity planning harder argues this article. Getting ahead of this potential problem is something worth thinking about for any growing organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jpmorgenthal.com/morgenthal/?p=256&quot;&gt;http://www.jpmorgenthal.com/morgenthal/?p=256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having system metrics is important, but without application level monitoring your users can have problems even while you think your servers are fine. This article walks through a great example with graphs and diagrams showing exactly how this comes about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/5/11/troubleshooting-response-time-problems-why-you-cannot-trust.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/5/11/troubleshooting-response-time-problems-why-you-cannot-trust.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FPM&lt;/span&gt; saw a few more releases this last week, amongst other things adding the ability to very easily convert Python packages from PyPi or local directories to DEBs or RPMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/ConvertingPython&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/ConvertingPython&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splinter looks a interesting Python based web functional testing tool. It looks a little like Capybara in Ruby, and provides three drivers for chrome, firefox and the python zopetestbrowser. The blog post demonstrates using it with Lettuce which is a Python &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BDD&lt;/span&gt; framework similar to Cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 21 &amp;#8211; 14th May 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few days late but a bit of a bumper issue. We&amp;#8217;ve also passed the 1000th subscriber so welcome to everyone who has joined recently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays Boston have released all the videos from the talks given so if you could&amp;#8217;nt make it along you can catch up on topics ranging from culture to devops in government and much talk of deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-boston/program/&quot;&gt;http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2011-boston/program/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people have started producing Chef recipes and Puppet manifests for installing the full Cloudfoundry vcap stack. I&amp;#8217;m much more interested in Vcap that I am another hosted platform and the easier it is to get up and running the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/auser/cloudfoundry-quickstart&quot;&gt;https://github.com/auser/cloudfoundry-quickstart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any distributed system you need a mechanism for the various components to transfer and exchange date efficiently. Both Protocol Buffers (from Google) and Thrift (originally developed at Facebook and now under the Apache banner) are solutions to this problem worth knowing about, and this article does a good job of comparing the technical details of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://floatingsun.net/articles/thrift-vs-protocol-buffers/&quot;&gt;http://floatingsun.net/articles/thrift-vs-protocol-buffers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing Javascript automatically has often been problematic. The folk at Zendesk have written up how they approach the problem using Jenkins, Jasmine, PhantomJS and JSHint. The post includes some useful rake tasks that you can use to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zendesk.com/blog/javascript-loves-ci&quot;&gt;http://www.zendesk.com/blog/javascript-loves-ci&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Debois unfortunately missed giving his presentation at goto this last week, but has kindly made the slides available anyway. Damn Abstraction : Development vs Operational Efficiency goes over the the many abstractions we introduce to software projects and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/damn-abstraction-development-vs-operational-efficiency&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/damn-abstraction-development-vs-operational-efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous deployment doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be hard argues John Wedgwood, with a good post about getting started with a minimum amount of fuss and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnwedgwood.com/continuous-deployment&quot;&gt;http://www.johnwedgwood.com/continuous-deployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a counter point to the above article Jim Bird argues that not only is continuous deployment hard in many environments, it&amp;#8217;s also not always a good idea. I liked this in particular because it doesn&amp;#8217;t focus on the technical problems as much as the process, security and external relations side of deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/05/continuous-deployment-is-no-holy-grail.html&quot;&gt;http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/05/continuous-deployment-is-no-holy-grail.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Crowley wrote a great article I missed at the start of the year. Arguing good packaging is a thing of beauty and releasing a nifty tool (Debra) which looks a very simple way of approaching the Debian packaging problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rcrowley.org/articles/packaging.html&quot;&gt;http://rcrowley.org/articles/packaging.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppet has been around for a good while now and it&amp;#8217;s nice to see more and more people writing up good advice. The main thing I took away from this particular article was that learning the whole puppet language, and how to extend it, is a good way of really getting the most out of the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nuknad.com/2011/05/10/puppet-lessons-learned/&quot;&gt;http://nuknad.com/2011/05/10/puppet-lessons-learned/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test::Right is described as an opinionated Selenium testing framework. It&amp;#8217;s from the folks at Sauce Labs who know a few things about functional testing and aims to lay lots of useful groundwork for writing this sort of test, avoiding many of the common maintenance and tight coupling pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/saucelabs/test_right&quot;&gt;https://github.com/saucelabs/test_right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People occasionally comment on the large dependency chain that the Chef server has, and Fatty, from the the Opscode folk, looks to be their answer to this. It appears to be a generic tool that allows for creating a single installable&lt;br /&gt;
shell-script that can be executed on the client side. Interesting for some usecases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adamhjk/fatty&quot;&gt;https://github.com/adamhjk/fatty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating large databases is hard work, but the folks at Sound Cloud have started releasing some of the tools they&amp;#8217;ve been having success with, entertainingly nicknamed the Large Hadron Migrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2011/05/introducing-the-large-hadron-migrator-3/&quot;&gt;http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2011/05/introducing-the-large-hadron-migrator-3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondering what in the network stack is taking up the time for a given &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; request? Ruok looks a pretty handy little tool for making multiple requests and displaying the time taken for things like &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; lookup, waiting for a connection or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 20 - 5th May 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/05/05/issue-20/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 20 &amp;#8211; 5th May 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to a more health mix of releases, interesting articles, tutorials and tools this week after the deluge of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; and cloud related experience reports last time. Anyone writing any interesting tools do let me know. If only I had time to try everything out personally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos from the previous London Devops event are now available. Big thanks to Adam, Ryan and Squirrel at YouDevise for letting us use their offices and for producing the videos. And thanks to Spike Morelli and James Hogarth for the two talks on Monitoring aided development and on Spacewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/22652468&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/22652468&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;ttp://vimeo.com/22653015&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/22653015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really excellent article from Adam Wiggins of Heroku about growing development teams. It&amp;#8217;s often missed amongst all the technology that scaling is also about scaling people, most organisations as requests, code bases and servers grow so does the team of people responsible for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/4/28/scaling_a_development_team/&quot;&gt;http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/4/28/scaling_a_development_team/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big Chef release landing this week. With 0.10.0 you get much better console behaviour, the new environments concept, easier ways of ignoring files when distributing them to nodes and encrypted data bags amongst other changes and fixes. If you&amp;#8217;re running your own Chef server you&amp;#8217;ll need to rebuild your search index though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/05/02/chef-0-10-0-released/&quot;&gt;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/05/02/chef-0-10-0-released/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at Puppet Labs are conducting a survey around devops practices. If you have a few minutes to answer a few questions I&amp;#8217;m sure the results will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://svy.mk/jNImMz&quot;&gt;http://svy.mk/jNImMz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long discussed Puppet move to use the Apache 2.0 licence instead of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt; has now happened. For most this probably makes no difference at all, although we might be some more interesting products integrated with puppet in the future because of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/relicensing-puppet-to-apache-2-0/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/relicensing-puppet-to-apache-2-0/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; programmers often get quite a big of stick but it&amp;#8217;s still a language which sees lots of use, so it&amp;#8217;s good to see comprehensive articles aimed at getting &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; folk up and running with continuous integration. Some pretty nice tools used here for static analysis to code smells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://erichogue.ca/2011/05/03/continuous-integration-in-php/&quot;&gt;http://erichogue.ca/2011/05/03/continuous-integration-in-php/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just found this article, from Mark Mayo and written in 2008, about the impending change in both the hosting environment and the role of the sysadmin. Describing the need for sysadmins to move more towards development, virtualisation and web native protocols. All still very relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vmunix.com/mark/blog/archives/2008/10/17/cloud-computing-is-a-sea-change-how-sysadmins-can-prepare/&quot;&gt;http://www.vmunix.com/mark/blog/archives/2008/10/17/cloud-computing-is-a-sea-change-how-sysadmins-can-prepare/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post from Damon Edwards about the risk of seeing devops as winning the fight for adoption. Depending on who you talk to either everyone is already doing all these things we&amp;#8217;re talking about or no-one has even heard of any of them. Timely reminder that evangelism is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon have written a pretty comprehensive outline of what went wrong, what they are doing to make it less likely in the future and offering affected customers some free service. They acknowledged communications issues during the outage and talk about how they&amp;#8217;ll improve that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/&quot;&gt;http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick roundup of popular of unix based orchestration tools. Anyone automating a few boxes would probably benefit from having one of these in their toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/05/unix-orchestration&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/05/unix-orchestration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rump looks an interesting addition for anyone using puppet. It brings with it a git based workflow and command line tool for easily running the client and pushing out changes to remote clients. Presentation from the recent puppetcamp and code available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/auxesis/rump-making-puppetmasterless-puppet-meaty&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/auxesis/rump-making-puppetmasterless-puppet-meaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether it&amp;#8217;s just because I&amp;#8217;m on holiday and have more time on my hands or whether it&amp;#8217;s just been a busy week but lots of news and interesting tool releases this last week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was busy sending the last issue Amazon &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; was having some rather epic issues. While everyones boxes where inaccessible people used the time to write blog posts about the downtime. The High Scalability blog has about 50 articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilesysadmin.net/ec2-outage-lessons&quot;&gt;http://agilesysadmin.net/ec2-outage-lessons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twilio use EC2 extensively but had very few issues, due to focusing on the principal of a &amp;#8220;unit-of-failure is a single host&amp;#8221;. This had meant they had avoided using &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; to avoid such a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan Sissel gave a talk about fpm at the recent BayLISA event. It&amp;#8217;s a great slide desk, laying down the problems with various forays in packaging and then showing code examples of using fpm to build debs and rpms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfMTdmczY2azlkcg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;pli=1&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0Aa9liCTsAyzRZGNtd3dkOTRfMTdmczY2azlkcg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;pli=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice write up by Mujtaba Hussain of mixing developers and operations staff members up a little, by loaning team members to different divisions to try and get better communication. Some good discussion in the comments too about what&amp;#8217;s worked for other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.realestate.com.au/2011/04/devops-and-associated-thoughts/&quot;&gt;http://techblog.realestate.com.au/2011/04/devops-and-associated-thoughts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common patterns for software build and release sounds like a great idea, and Julian Simpson wrote an article for the Spring 2011 issue of Methods &amp;amp; Tools on just that, based on conversations at last years &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SPA&lt;/span&gt; Conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obligatory Vagrant article this time again with a thorough write up of the benefits and purpose of Vagrant, as well as a big Drupal example. This is probably the first time I&amp;#8217;ve seen a shared Vagrantfile, which is a great idea come to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite looks pretty interesting for adhoc graphing duties, but the installation and setup isn&amp;#8217;t trivial. This article walks through all the steps and looks like it&amp;#8217;s going to turn into a series about using Graphite. Look forward the the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2011/04/installing-and-configuring-graphite.html&quot;&gt;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2011/04/installing-and-configuring-graphite.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Machine Test Harness is an interesting take on writing tests for configuration management tools. Uses &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;KVM&lt;/span&gt; under the hood to take snapshots at different states for testing against. Lacking documentation at the moment though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gregretkowski/vmth&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gregretkowski/vmth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at Rackspace have released a preview of their open source deployment tool, Cast. It&amp;#8217;s an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; driven Node.js application which aims to let you automate deployment of applications and services, although it feels odd that the example given is for Redis rather than say a web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cast-project.org/faq/&quot;&gt;http://cast-project.org/faq/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulp is a Python application for managing software repositories and their associated content, such as packages, errata, and distributions. Another tool in this area from RedHat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 18 &amp;#8211; 21st April 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another busy week, with lots of interesting tools, announcements and goings on. As I write this issue Amazon EC2 is having some nasty downtime issues. Hopefully next week I can feature some good advice on how to run things across multiple zones more easily and mitigate such problems. Anyone still staring at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; status dashboard rather than sleeping has my thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMWare announced what they&amp;#8217;ve been working on of late, and it&amp;#8217;s an open source platform as a service. It currently runs Java, Ruby and Node.js applications with hopefully more on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudfoundry.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.cloudfoundry.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in playing with OpenStack, like anything else it&amp;#8217;s useful to be able to do so locally. This article covers settings up the whole OpenStack platform under Virtualbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://uksysadmin.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/running-openstack-under-virtualbox-a-complete-guide/&quot;&gt;http://uksysadmin.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/running-openstack-under-virtualbox-a-complete-guide/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent London CI meetups have been excellent. I was out of town for the last one but luckily the video of Chris Read talking about evolving Continuous Delivery is already up online. Worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/a-sneak-preview-of-evolving-continuous-delivery/js-1600&quot;&gt;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/a-sneak-preview-of-evolving-continuous-delivery/js-1600&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of companies are both taking the build process more seriously and also often looking to take that responsibility and place it in the hands of one person. Kief Morris writes up why this is a bad idea, and why distributing this across a development team is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://grokandroll.com/Build_Monkey_Antipattern.html&quot;&gt;http://grokandroll.com/Build_Monkey_Antipattern.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well put together tutorial with clear code examples and good screen shots. It covers installing software (in this case Drizzle) onto EC2 using Chef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://posulliv.github.com/2011/04/07/drizzle-chef.html&quot;&gt;http://posulliv.github.com/2011/04/07/drizzle-chef.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a development environment on demand using Vagrant is one I&amp;#8217;m pretty keen on. This article again introduces the tool as well as pointing out a couple of issues the author ran into in getting things up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biven.org/writing/dev_on_demand_with_vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://biven.org/writing/dev_on_demand_with_vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in the position to be looking at different configuration management tools this product matrix might be useful. It covers a wide range of tools in some detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/software/sysconfigtools/overview&quot;&gt;http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/software/sysconfigtools/overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Vincent is looking for some feedback on what the Operational primitives are in peoples workflows, specifically related to the tool Noah that&amp;#8217;s in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/04/operational-primitives.html&quot;&gt;http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/04/operational-primitives.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good reminder that using trending data collected in tools like Ganglia or Collectd is perfect for powering alerting in tools such as Nagios. If you&amp;#8217;re not already going this it&amp;#8217;s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vuksan.com/blog/2011/04/19/use-your-trending-data-for-alerting/&quot;&gt;http://vuksan.com/blog/2011/04/19/use-your-trending-data-for-alerting/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week to go until the deadline for paper proposals for a special issue of Cutters to be edited by Patrick Debois. This looks particularly interesting as the list of topics is all about culture, not technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cutter.com/content-and-analysis/journals-and-reports/cutter-it-journal/callforpapers03.html&quot;&gt;http://www.cutter.com/content-and-analysis/journals-and-reports/cutter-it-journal/callforpapers03.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly some projects are encouraging folks to install software by running a remote shell script. This might be evil in many ways but folks are using it so I&amp;#8217;m glad a project like Gosh exists. Gosh gives you a bit of an insight into the code you&amp;#8217;re about to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/gosh&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sstephenson/gosh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a one man war against the failings of ruby packaging Jordan Sissel has been working on a simple way of creating system packages from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RVM&lt;/span&gt; builds. Very promising.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 17 &amp;#8211; 11th April 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry for the delay in getting this issue out, but I hope stuffing it with even more good content will compensate a little. I spent the end of last week in Edinburgh for the Scottish Ruby Conference and, as well as watching some pretty good talks, met a few subscribers and talked an awful lot about Chef, Puppet and Vagrant. Good to meet everyone I bumped into.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always found Varnish documentation by jumping between mailing lists and various bits of the internet, for most things I&amp;#8217;ll now probably go to this epic blog post. It doesn&amp;#8217;t just cover the obvious caching of static files, but demonstrates more advantages tricks with dynamic content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devblog.factual.com/practical-guide-to-varnish&quot;&gt;http://devblog.factual.com/practical-guide-to-varnish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Allspaw&amp;#8217;s latest post is a pretty thought provoking read, attempting to introduce Resilience Engineering and position it at the heart of how business prioritises activities. It&amp;#8217;s part I as well so presumably more on the subject on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/04/07/resilience-engineering-part-i/&quot;&gt;http://www.kitchensoap.com/2011/04/07/resilience-engineering-part-i/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rackspace have rolled out a load balancer feature for their cloud stack. This article covers the details of setting it up for use with other Rackspace cloud instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudservers.rackspacecloud.com/index.php/Configuring_a_Cloud_Load_Balancer&quot;&gt;http://cloudservers.rackspacecloud.com/index.php/Configuring_a_Cloud_Load_Balancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s just useful to have a big old list of bullet points to remind you about a broad topic. This post from Ricky Ho could be useful if you don&amp;#8217;t know where to start, although it would be nice to see lots more references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://architects.dzone.com/news/scalable-system-design-0&quot;&gt;http://architects.dzone.com/news/scalable-system-design-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replay Solutions carried out a survey of companies, focusing on management and larger organisations around devops. This might be useful to those fighting the good fight and needing to convince the powers that be. The survey results are available as a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; from that page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://replaysolutions.com/company/news/59&quot;&gt;http://replaysolutions.com/company/news/59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finding more and more long, well thought out posts that I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll be referring back to again and again. This post from Stephanie Dean covers processes and practices to use and put in place when everything around you is going wrong. It ends with a great list of responsibilities for the different groups involved that everyone should read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stephaniekdean.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/eventmgmt/&quot;&gt;http://stephaniekdean.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/eventmgmt/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altering based on a percentage is pretty common, and is the default in many popular monitoring applications. It&amp;#8217;s also counter productive and sometimes dangerous according to Chris Siebenmann. He argues very well that the defaults exist because it&amp;#8217;s easy to do, and as someone who has been warning about a machine with 20GB of disk left in the past because of this I&amp;#8217;m coming round to the same viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/NoAlertOnPercentages&quot;&gt;http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/NoAlertOnPercentages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more folks are writing up their continuous deployment setups, which I think is a great think. The more shared experience the more we can get to a stage where common tools for things like this exist, lowering the costs and barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prettyprint.me/2011/01/24/continuous-deployment-at-outbrain/&quot;&gt;http://prettyprint.me/2011/01/24/continuous-deployment-at-outbrain/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a fan of using monit, daemon, logrotate and cron for running daemonised services then it&amp;#8217;s probably not because of the setup and configuration. pmonit caught my eye as a painless looking approach to getting these all working together quickly. Although I&amp;#8217;d be tempted to pull some of this out into Chef recipes or Puppet manifests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emgee/pmonit&quot;&gt;https://github.com/emgee/pmonit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent blog post and application code from Posterous. They ran into issues around optimising caching, and build some pretty impressive tools to allow log play back and generate statistics on cache behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technology.posterous.com/planning-and-engineering-your-cache-for-maxim-0&quot;&gt;http://technology.posterous.com/planning-and-engineering-your-cache-for-maxim-0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vincentchu/sim_cache&quot;&gt;https://github.com/vincentchu/sim_cache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who end up talking about low level monitoring of Java applications always sound angry. This tool acts as a connector between &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JMX&lt;/span&gt; and a number of different monitoring systems including cacti, rrdtool, graphite and plain old stdout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 16 &amp;#8211; 31st March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll start this issue with a bit of a call to action. It turns out that the Devops Wikipedia page needs some love. It&amp;#8217;s led to a few confused views this last week or so and as more and more people come across the term it&amp;#8217;s something folks will turn to. It would be great if the community chipped in on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps. Onwards to the real content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always love posts where people describe, ideally with diagrams, how a system architecture works. Digg posted this interesting blog post this week doing just that. It goes into a little detail about the services they use and the technology stack they employ. More posts are promised as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://about.digg.com/blog/how-digg-is-built&quot;&gt;http://about.digg.com/blog/how-digg-is-built&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Debois has been pushing Vagrant in a small team setup and a complex application with great results. The post is a great walkthrough of the how and why, this some good observations about using a tool like vagrant in a team setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jedi.be/blog/2011/03/28/using-vagrant-as-a-team/&quot;&gt;http://jedi.be/blog/2011/03/28/using-vagrant-as-a-team/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been showing various people Chef recently and one problem a few people have commented on is the discoverability of some of the documentation. Sean OMeara pointed out that the docs are vast and broken up into many pages on the Opscode wiki and wrote up a great index along with a brief explanation of each of the main topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/3889872012/a-can-of-condensed-chef-documentation&quot;&gt;http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/3889872012/a-can-of-condensed-chef-documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing driving lots of the talk around devops is the move towards software as a service, whether that means inside a large company or paying a third party for an internet based setup. This post has some nice observations about the changes needed if you&amp;#8217;re more familiar with the more traditional software delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omniti.com/seeds/from-making-software-to-running-saas&quot;&gt;http://omniti.com/seeds/from-making-software-to-running-saas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.I.Pienaar continues his self appointed task of making monitoring better. I&amp;#8217;m liking the sound of a framework that can build monitoring systems, meaning you&amp;#8217;ll have to add code to the mix to get something useful but that should be specific to your needs, and able to evolve with you over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/25/monitoring_framework_event_correlation.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/25/monitoring_framework_event_correlation.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice writeup of DevOps &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ATL&lt;/span&gt; in Atlanta. Some good points about how particular pain points and skunkworks projects, especially in larger more formal organisations, can help embed newer practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/the-state-of-devops-down-south-tips-on-deploying-devops-practices/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/the-state-of-devops-down-south-tips-on-deploying-devops-practices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always like being reminded why something is important. These slides on continuous integration are a good read, or maybe something to sent to your boss or colleagues who are interested in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/o19s/turbocharge-your-automated-tests-with-ci&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/o19s/turbocharge-your-automated-tests-with-ci&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter released the Murder deployment tool using BitTorrent a while ago. Russ Garrett has just released a Python variant of the idea, but with fewer opinions about how you&amp;#8217;ll use it. As Russ put it &amp;#8220;It was designed for pushing code out to a number of production systems. You can probably use it for other things.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 15 - 24th March 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/03/24/issue-15/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 15 &amp;#8211; 24th March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This issue contains the word metrics repeatedly and it seems more and more we&amp;#8217;re focused on gathering data to make the case for what we&amp;#8217;re trying to do. That might be code or infrastructure changes or wholesale business improvement, but all things considered this analytical approach feels like a good thing to me. But then my background was as an experimental Physicist so I&amp;#8217;m probably biased.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of devops is organisational change, and metrics provide a good discussion point to try and prove why change is needed. But metrics can be used for the opposite reason, eloquently described here as using metrics as a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/JustifyingChanges&quot;&gt;http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/JustifyingChanges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of writing tests for configuration management has been around for a while but this take on it looks particularly interesting. Using cucumber to make assertions based on puppet providers looks a pretty simple approach code wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/puppet/puppet-cucumber-providers.html&quot;&gt;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/puppet/puppet-cucumber-providers.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOpsDays Boston 2011 sounded like it was a great event and this writeup of one of the openspace events sounds interesting. 20 people spoke about using metrics for tracking the effects of changes in your Dev / Ops environments and jotted down a pretty good list of interesting things to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroturnaround.com/blog/how-to-measure-the-effectiveness-of-implementing-devops/&quot;&gt;http://www.zeroturnaround.com/blog/how-to-measure-the-effectiveness-of-implementing-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More good Vagrant tutorials, this time with a really good end to end &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; example going from the why to a full set of Puppet manifests for bootstrapping a symphony development environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/&quot;&gt;http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moving Fast at Scale microconference at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt; looked like one of the highlights of the week and the increasingly nice folks at Etsy have released all the slides from the event. These covered Scaling Startups, Continuous Deployment, Etsy&amp;#8217;s inhouse deployment tool Deployinator and talk of Metrics-driven Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/03/19/moving-fast-at-scale-slides-and-reprise/&quot;&gt;http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/03/19/moving-fast-at-scale-slides-and-reprise/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However much you love Nagios (or your monitoring tool of choice) it likely feels somewhat dated when it comes to dealing with a modern dynamic infrastructure where new machines come and go regularly and often automatically. R.I.Pienaar has been prototyping a new monitoring system that aims to solve that problem as well as potentially many others. One to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/19/thinking_about_monitoring_frameworks.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/19/thinking_about_monitoring_frameworks.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of Devops is definitely self improvement, and this article about steps to improve as a sysadmin is interesting, the focus on tasks that might historically simply been shunted to developers in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cwebber.ucr.edu/2011/03/the-journey-to-senior-sysadmin/&quot;&gt;http://cwebber.ucr.edu/2011/03/the-journey-to-senior-sysadmin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stackops is a distro based on Ubuntu 10.04 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LTS&lt;/span&gt; Server that allows for installing the various components of the OpenStack Nova platform via a simple to use installer. If Openstack is the ‘Linux’ of the cloud operating systems, StackOps wants to be the reference distribution of this operating system which seems a nobel and lofty goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackops.com/2011/03/23/stackops-distro-smart-installer-deploy-openstack-in-your-datacenter/&quot;&gt;http://blog.stackops.com/2011/03/23/stackops-distro-smart-installer-deploy-openstack-in-your-datacenter/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re deploying applications to Heroku, then Heroku-Bartender might be of interest. It&amp;#8217;s a very simple continuous deployment tool which shows you all the commits to a given Git branch and allows you to trigger a deployment of one via a web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 14 &amp;#8211; 17th March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More interesting news and tools from last week. If anyone has anything they think would be of interest to folks do let me know at gareth@morethanseven.net&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to get a site built this week to provide a list of Vagrant base boxes. The question comes up on Twitter or blog posts or mailing lists pretty regularly. Hopefully a few people find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vagrantbox.es/&quot;&gt;http://www.vagrantbox.es/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon have just expanded their virtual networking for Amazon EC2, adding in lots more functionality which to my mind make it much more useful. You can now run with a single public subnet, with public and private subnets, with Internet and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; access or with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; access only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/03/new-approach-amazon-ec2-networking.html&quot;&gt;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/03/new-approach-amazon-ec2-networking.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean Wilson has been doing some interesting things around testing deployments and infrastructure changes using Nagios, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NRPE&lt;/span&gt; Runner looks a handy tool if you&amp;#8217;re interested in doing the same. The basic premise is to have a command allowing you to run your nagios checks like a test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/commandline/introducing-nrpe-runner.html&quot;&gt;http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/commandline/introducing-nrpe-runner.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Dziuba&amp;#8217;s latest article covers what and why to monitor, and what makes for a good system that can be easily checked. The focus of monitoring checks should be to keep them Informative and Actionable, which I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teddziuba.com/2011/03/monitoring-theory.html&quot;&gt;http://teddziuba.com/2011/03/monitoring-theory.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zed Shaw always writes good opinion pieces and this one has a number of good points. The basic gist is that more programmers should actually learn how statistics really works, which I have to agree with. The more we look for evidence for application or process improvements the more important it is to get the analysis right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html&quot;&gt;http://zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pretty formal article introducing some folks to the concepts behind Devops. I&amp;#8217;m quite interested in the idea that Devops might be a sort-of bridge between IT Service management with Agile development practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmcrossroads.com/behaviorally-speaking/13925-behaviorally-speaking-devops-101&quot;&gt;http://www.cmcrossroads.com/behaviorally-speaking/13925-behaviorally-speaking-devops-101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branches are an important part of lots of development workflows, and with the increasing adoption of version control for configuration management file and the mantra of &amp;#8220;infrastructure as code&amp;#8221; some people are starting to talk about how to use branches for these too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.carlossanchez.eu/2011/03/15/new-challenges-from-devops-development-cycle-for-your-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;http://blog.carlossanchez.eu/2011/03/15/new-challenges-from-devops-development-cycle-for-your-infrastructure/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice folks at Etsy continue releasing various useful tools, this time Logster is a very handy looking tool for parsing log files and generating metrics for Graphite and Ganglia from the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maciej Ceglowski has written up the full story of the days and nights when the internet descended on Pinboard after Yahoo attempted to kill off Delicious. All sorts of good recommendations and observations about running a site under load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pinboard.in/blog/173/&quot;&gt;http://pinboard.in/blog/173/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being both a big fan of testing and of monitoring I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking for a while about all the parallels between the two. This blog post by Grig Gheorghiu covers just that, expanding on a number of similarities. I&amp;#8217;d have liked to see mention of overlapping tools or the lack thereof as I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to write something on that myself for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2011/03/monitoring-is-for-ops-what-testing-is.html&quot;&gt;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2011/03/monitoring-is-for-ops-what-testing-is.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts have been writing interesting things about the whole devops idea and I thought this set of observations from a large &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; event were interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.forrester.com/dave_west/11-03-09-dev_ops_fell_on_deaf_ears_at_ibm_pulse_2011&quot;&gt;http://blogs.forrester.com/dave_west/11-03-09-dev_ops_fell_on_deaf_ears_at_ibm_pulse_2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting article from Erwin Bolwidt about what he terms Stateless Computing. This goes into more details, along with a clear outline of the advantages and some practical tips, on using an image based deployment approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.worldturner.com/worldturner/entry/stateless_computing&quot;&gt;http://blog.worldturner.com/worldturner/entry/stateless_computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Robins from Opscode gave what sounded like a great talk at DevopsDays Boston called Devops Culture Hacks. Martin J. Logan was on hand to live blog it in detail, covering various ways you can help create real change in organisations that already have a way of working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/2011/03/08/devops-culture-hacks/&quot;&gt;http://devops.com/2011/03/08/devops-culture-hacks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 19th of May in London &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UKUUG&lt;/span&gt; are running a full day workshop on Debian packaging run by Phil Hands. This sounds like a great way of getting starting with system packaging if you&amp;#8217;re wondering where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ukuug.org/events/debian2011/&quot;&gt;http://www.ukuug.org/events/debian2011/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mytop has been around for a long time, but it&amp;#8217;s nice to see an introductory article showing how to use it for those that might not have come across it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.junauza.com/2011/02/live-performance-monitor-for-your-mysql.html&quot;&gt;http://www.junauza.com/2011/02/live-performance-monitor-for-your-mysql.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabric now has a 1.0 release, including improvements to the main workhorses of sudo, run, put and get. Also puts in place some of the groundwork for writing tests for fabfiles and task namespacing in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://readthedocs.org/docs/fabric/en/1.0.0/changes/1.0.html&quot;&gt;http://readthedocs.org/docs/fabric/en/1.0.0/changes/1.0.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knife is the command line tool used for managing Chef nodes and it&amp;#8217;s now been much improved for those using Windows environments. Knife-windows adds commands to bootstrap and run commands on remote windows machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opscode/knife-windows&quot;&gt;https://github.com/opscode/knife-windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve not spent enough time looking at looks like ZooKeeper to see where they fit in, but this article takes on that subject and also introduces an alternative tool, Noah, which looks particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 12 - 1st March 2011</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2011/03/01/issue-12/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 12 &amp;#8211; 1st March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A big thank you to everyone who filled out the survey last week. So far I&amp;#8217;ve amassed over 600 responses which should make for some good analysis. Now with interesting devops new for the week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big news this week was Amazon&amp;#8217;s launch of CloudFormation, which is a way of creating templates to describe your infrastructure, which can then be executed to provision EC2 instances and other &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; components automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&quot;&gt;http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On hearing about CloudFormation various parts of the internet exploded with comments about how they no longer needed Chef or Puppet, missing the difference between configuration management and provisioning (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; specific provisioning at that) entirely. Luckily Mitchell Hashimoto (of Vagrant fame) and Stephen Nelson-Smith both came to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilesysadmin.net/cloudformation&quot;&gt;http://agilesysadmin.net/cloudformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitchellhashimoto.com/post/3526628232/cloudformation-the-big-picture&quot;&gt;http://mitchellhashimoto.com/post/3526628232/cloudformation-the-big-picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.I.Pienaar meanwhile was busy showing how CloudFormation can be useful (with a great mcollective example) and then breaking down some of the good and bad points about the current implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/02/26/mcollective_101_demo_using_aws_cloudformation.php&quot;&gt;http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/02/26/mcollective_101_demo_using_aws_cloudformation.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js got some nice things said about it by the smart folk at SimpleGeo. They argue that Node.js is a good candidate for production services right now and outline some of the reasons they chose it and things they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/2/22/is-nodejs-becoming-a-part-of-the-stack-simplegeo-says-yes.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/2/22/is-nodejs-becoming-a-part-of-the-stack-simplegeo-says-yes.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in Chicago this Saturday you might be interested in a Puppet Hack-a-thon being organised by Martin J. Logan. Two tracks and Puppetlabs founder Teyo Tyree should make for an interesting event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/devops/events/16513536/&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/devops/events/16513536/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tav has reworked the core of Fabric to add all sorts of shiny new features and remove a few scars. An environment variable manager, remote script execution, contexts (more advanced roles and hosts control), parallel deployment, stages, a build-in shell, autocompletion and even colours for output. And some other things too. I really hope this gets merged upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tav.espians.com/fabric-python-with-cleaner-api-and-parallel-deployment-support.html&quot;&gt;http://tav.espians.com/fabric-python-with-cleaner-api-and-parallel-deployment-support.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting presentation, that actually works just reading the slides. Interesting alternative to package installation and bootstrapping using Fabric and an extension called Cuisine. And details of system monitoring using Watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/ffunction/fabric-cuisine-and-watchdog-for-server-administration-in-python&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/ffunction/fabric-cuisine-and-watchdog-for-server-administration-in-python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 11 &amp;#8211; 22th February 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last week was pretty light on tools so I&amp;#8217;ve this week I&amp;#8217;ve found all sorts of interesting looking new toys to play with. I&amp;#8217;d love to see and stories of success or failure if anyone tries any of these out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m constantly interested in how everyone does deployment subtly or wildly differently so I&amp;#8217;ve decided to run a survey rather than just base my thoughts on my own personal experience and here say. If you have 5 minutes and have anything to do with deploying web sites or applications then please fill in the following Google form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/webdeployment&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/webdeployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases you don&amp;#8217;t want or can&amp;#8217;t have lots of automated small releases as you push code but you do want everything that comes with the workflow around continuous deployment. A good article about terminology, around why the recent book was called continuous delivery and why deployment should maybe have been release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/&quot;&gt;http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just want to be in the bay area and this event on Data Collection and Logging looks great. You&amp;#8217;ve probably seen talks about processing data with Hadoop, but how did that data get collected in the first place? Are you using Scribe, Chukwa, or something else? And where are you keeping all that data until you&amp;#8217;re ready to process it?  What about after you process it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Area-Large-Scale-Production-Engineering/events/15481136/&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Area-Large-Scale-Production-Engineering/events/15481136/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pretty interesting argument that devops is a way of insourcing work back into development teams that&amp;#8217;s previously been outsourced. Drawing parallels to how agile made testing sexy and got people interested in tooling. Worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2011/02/16/the-developer-landgrab-another-way-to-look-at-devops/&quot;&gt;http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2011/02/16/the-developer-landgrab-another-way-to-look-at-devops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always nice to see more people talking about vagrant, very quick example but it does contain a link to a Centos base box for the latest version of Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maestrodev.com/blogs/vagrant-is-my-new-best-friend&quot;&gt;http://www.maestrodev.com/blogs/vagrant-is-my-new-best-friend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice list of 8 things to think about when deploying mysql databases, with a specific focus on EC2 environments. Not loads of detail but a nice list to have handy if you&amp;#8217;re not already a database expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iheavy.com/2011/02/21/deploying-mysql-on-amazon-ec2-best-practices/&quot;&gt;http://www.iheavy.com/2011/02/21/deploying-mysql-on-amazon-ec2-best-practices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting looking continuous deployment framework that makes use of ZooKeeper. At it&amp;#8217;s heart a daemon you install on your production machines and a command to trigger those nodes to pull your latest application from your continuous integration system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mconigliaro/conveyor&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mconigliaro/conveyor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment tools are definitely interesting lots of people at the moment and Meerkatalyst looks like an interesting continuous deployment server allowing developers to deploy &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.net or Ruby projects. Currently invite only but you can sign up on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meerkatalyst.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.meerkatalyst.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poni describes itself as a systems management tool for defining, deploying and verifying complex multi-node computer systems. It looks like a pretty comprehensive command line tool with cloud provisioning baked in as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://melor.github.com/poni/index.html&quot;&gt;http://melor.github.com/poni/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally yet another deployment tool, this time called Beehive which is written in Erlang and Ruby. Again lots of good examples and documentation for getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getbeehive.com/&quot;&gt;http://getbeehive.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And we&amp;#8217;re already onto the 10th edition. To celebrate I&amp;#8217;ve gone and paid for an upgrade to my Mailchimp account, meaning that all the links you see should now not be horrible link tracking things. Lots of people complained about that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m organising another talks evening in London on the 3rd of March, kindly hosted by the nice folks at youDevise again. We&amp;#8217;ll have three talks; one on Spacewalk, one on monitoring and another to be announced. Only a few tickets left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://londondevops.eventwax.com/devops-talks&quot;&gt;https://londondevops.eventwax.com/devops-talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another London event, this time of the paid variety from Thoughtworks. Jez Humble and Chris Turner, are running a full day workshop on March 10th on continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of a couple of Puppet articles I read with interest this week. This one covers self-classifying puppet nodes, and is a good walkthrough with code examples of using puppet and mcollective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nuknad.com/2011/02/11/self-classifying-puppet-nodes/&quot;&gt;http://nuknad.com/2011/02/11/self-classifying-puppet-nodes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second puppet article, about the best way of separating whether you want something installed and whether you want it running in a puppet module. Some good alternatives and discussion in the comments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/ensure-running&quot;&gt;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/ensure-running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of devops talk is still focused on the technology and I&amp;#8217;m probably as guilty of featuring more technology material than anything else. This article caught my eye this week though on what devops really means to business minded folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evolven.com/blog/devops-misunderstandings-and-how-devops-really-drives-business-needs.html&quot;&gt;http://www.evolven.com/blog/devops-misunderstandings-and-how-devops-really-drives-business-needs.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrations are always hairy and this post has some nice details about how Involver moved from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; recently. Just enough juicy details to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://invalidlogic.com/2011/02/11/how-we-did-a-datacenter-migration-with-no-downtime/&quot;&gt;http://invalidlogic.com/2011/02/11/how-we-did-a-datacenter-migration-with-no-downtime/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought provoking video from Randy Shoup talking at QCon about how programming might evolve as more and more things take advantage of cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Evolving-Programming-for-the-Cloud&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Evolving-Programming-for-the-Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the slides from the presentations at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt; are showing up online. I particularly liked Joshua&amp;#8217;s Chef 101 and application deployment double presentation. A good introduction in the first half and a detailed look at deploying apps using Chef in the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jtimberman/fosdem-chef101appdeploy&quot;&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/jtimberman/fosdem-chef101appdeploy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatula looks an interesting tool for anyone using Chef. It provides a simple command line interface to the Opscode cookbooks stored in the official repository, allowing you to search, get details of and download quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 9 - 8th February 2011</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 9 &amp;#8211; 8th February 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the ninth instalment of Devops Weekly. A little later than intended as I&amp;#8217;ve been in Brussels for the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt; conference. But we&amp;#8217;re back to being out on Tuesday again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DevOps Survey 2010 results are in. Over 200 people filled in the survey and the results have been collated and graphed. Worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekle.id.au/2011/01/devops-survey-2010-results.html&quot;&gt;http://www.geekle.id.au/2011/01/devops-survey-2010-results.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgium is definitely on a roll when it comes to useful technical events and Load looks to be no exception. It&amp;#8217;s in Wilrijk on April 16th-17th and is geared towards Linux sysadmins and people interested in linux administration. A call for papers is up now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loadays.org/news/call-presentations&quot;&gt;http://www.loadays.org/news/call-presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More proof that at least the analysts are listening to people about devops. I&amp;#8217;m not convinced that platform as a service is really the answer to everything but the comments in particular are worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/11-02-07-i_dont_want_devops_i_want_noops&quot;&gt;http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/11-02-07-i_dont_want_devops_i_want_noops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brightbox, the UK based web host, have launched a load balancer component to their cloud hosting platform. Unlike Amazon &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; you can point an IP address at a load balancer, meaning you don&amp;#8217;t have to use &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; records, which might be useful to some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.brightbox.co.uk/posts/cloud-load-balancers-beta&quot;&gt;http://blog.brightbox.co.uk/posts/cloud-load-balancers-beta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m hearing more and more people try to configure systems so they don&amp;#8217;t need to ever login to them. This article is a pretty good explanation of how you might come to that conclusion and what you need to think about to make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://me.andering.com/2011/02/03/server-login-considered-harmful/&quot;&gt;http://me.andering.com/2011/02/03/server-login-considered-harmful/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things still take lots of commands and the first step to automating them is to write everything down. This article covers creating a bootable virtual application using VMWare and does just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.worldturner.com/worldturner/entry/creating_a_bootable_virtual_appliance&quot;&gt;http://blog.worldturner.com/worldturner/entry/creating_a_bootable_virtual_appliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah is a lightweight node and service registry based on Zookeeper. Zookepper did always strike me as interesting but pretty impenetrable. Noah uses Redis on the backend and is written in Ruby and already looks well documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lusis/Noah&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lusis/Noah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node Control is a node.js based system admin and code deployment too for executing commands on many remote machines in parallel via ssh. I&amp;#8217;m finding it interesting that node.js is cropping up more and more as a platform for writing system tools like this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 8 &amp;#8211; 28th January 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the eighth instalment of Devops Weekly. More than 660 people have now signed up and the list is growing every week. Thanks for sticking around and do let me know what you&amp;#8217;d like to see more (or less) of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are interested in building a shared vocabulary and understanding at the moment, including this take on documenting release management. The author is seeking input from devops flavoured folk so any ideas you have should be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erp4it.com/erp4it/2011/01/release-management-integration-pattern-seeking-devops-comments.html&quot;&gt;http://www.erp4it.com/erp4it/2011/01/release-management-integration-pattern-seeking-devops-comments.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Relic have a great product for monitoring Java and Ruby applications and publish the odd bit of interesting insight into what they get up to too. They recently moved database servers and documented how they went about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.newrelic.com/2011/01/26/how-do-you-move-more-than-6000-customers-in-2-hours/&quot;&gt;http://blog.newrelic.com/2011/01/26/how-do-you-move-more-than-6000-customers-in-2-hours/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt; is only weeks away and the official site has started publishing a few interviews. Spike, who some people might have seen talk at the last devopsdays event in Hamburg, is talking again this time about monitoring and the transition from being a full time sysadmin to a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fosdem.org/2011/interview/spike-morelli&quot;&gt;http://fosdem.org/2011/interview/spike-morelli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMVU&lt;/span&gt;, who originally described how they went about continuous deployment, have written up how they deal with intermittently failing tests across a rather large test suite. Interesting problem and solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.imvu.com/2011/01/19/buildbot-and-intermittent-tests/&quot;&gt;http://engineering.imvu.com/2011/01/19/buildbot-and-intermittent-tests/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet Labs is hosting its bi-annual conference for users and developers in Amsterdam on April 28th and 29th. Early bird tickets are available now and the call for papers ends March 6th for those interested in speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-camp/puppet-camp-ams-2011-info&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-camp/puppet-camp-ams-2011-info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always nice to be able to experiment with a web &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; before you jump head long into code and Jazor looks a nice way of pushing and prodding &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; based services when curl isn&amp;#8217;t quite the right tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://conigliaro.org/2011/01/24/jazor-a-simple-command-line-json-parsing-tool/&quot;&gt;http://conigliaro.org/2011/01/24/jazor-a-simple-command-line-json-parsing-tool/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pallet describes itself as an agile cloud development tool for developers, sysadmins, and operations. It&amp;#8217;s a clojure based tool which doesn&amp;#8217;t use a central server or require you to install an agent on each node. The blog contains links to good presentation materials and example code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 7 &amp;#8211; 21st January 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the seventh instalment of Devops Weekly. More tools and events this week than news, so if you&amp;#8217;re looking for things to spend your time on this should hopefully be a good issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fosdem is just weeks away and a specific devops meal out is being organised again for the night before the conference. Last year was a good opportunity to put faces to names so I&amp;#8217;ll definitely be along again this year. Register as places are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsfosdem2011.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;http://devopsfosdem2011.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet Labs are running several masters 3 day courses in Boston and Brussels in the coming weeks. If you&amp;#8217;re using puppet and somewhere in the vicinity these might be useful for you or your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/events/boston-training-jan-11/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/events/boston-training-jan-11/&lt;/a&gt; Jan 31 &amp;#8211; Feb 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/events/brussels-training-feb-11/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/events/brussels-training-feb-11/&lt;/a&gt; Feb 8 &amp;#8211; Feb 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief glimpse into some of the technical details surrounding how Google do large scale experiments and testing. This blog post has picked up on a few interesting snippets of how Google go about deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://glinden.blogspot.com/2011/01/experiment-infrastructure-at-google.html&quot;&gt;http://glinden.blogspot.com/2011/01/experiment-infrastructure-at-google.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Crawley from Devstructure launched Gimme Servers this week, which is a super simple interface to launching Rackspace cloud instances. If you&amp;#8217;ve used the existing web based dashboard you&amp;#8217;ll know why this exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gimmeservers.com/&quot;&gt;http://gimmeservers.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon launched Elastic Beanstalk, which provides more of a platform as a service layer on top of EC2. At the moment that means an autoscaling tomcat instance along with build in load balancing and auto-scaling of resources based on utilisation. Very nice looking indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/01/introducing-elastic-beanstalk.html&quot;&gt;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/01/introducing-elastic-beanstalk.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shameless self promotion warning. Here&amp;#8217;s article I write last week regarding why software developers like me should care more about system packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages.html&quot;&gt;http://morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FPM&lt;/span&gt; looks awesome. If you have to deal with gems or node.js npm packages but you&amp;#8217;d rather be dealing with rpms or debs, or you have a debian package with some maintainer scripts you&amp;#8217;d rather strip out and manage using chef/puppet, then this tool is for you. It&amp;#8217;s early days it seems but I&amp;#8217;m hoping other input and output formats will be added soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagiosharder is a tool for querying the state of a nagios instance from a nice Ruby &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. This looks ideal if you&amp;#8217;re trying to show dashboards or reports without the rest of Nagios getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/railsmachine/nagiosharder&quot;&gt;https://github.com/railsmachine/nagiosharder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing with large data sets is good fun, but managing all the software required might not be your thing. In which case this set of tools from Infochimps might be useful. It&amp;#8217;s a series of chef recipes designed specifically for managing Hadoop and Cassandra clusters, including creating and mounting &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; and setting up &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NFS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 6 &amp;#8211; 14th January 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the sixth instalment of Devops Weekly. I&amp;#8217;ve had a few people contact me about putting job opportunities in the list and I&amp;#8217;m giving that a go this week. Shout up if don&amp;#8217;t like this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston is the venue for the next devopsdays conference and you have until February 20th to get your proposals in if you&amp;#8217;d like to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/blog/2011/01/08/boston-devopsdays-7-8-march-2011/&quot;&gt;http://devopsdays.org/blog/2011/01/08/boston-devopsdays-7-8-march-2011/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua Timberman from Opscode is in London next month to give a 3 day Chef Fundamentals course from 31st of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilesysadmin.net/chef-fundamentals&quot;&gt;http://agilesysadmin.net/chef-fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of the tools I generally use work only on Linux or Unix environments but some people are trying to take along of these same ideas into the Windows world. Jon Topper is currently trying to organise a get together in London and asking people when they could meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doodle.com/zx46wyxy79u53pd6&quot;&gt;http://www.doodle.com/zx46wyxy79u53pd6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great article re-imaginging stored procedures. DBA&amp;#8217;s and developers working more closely together sounds like a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jaksprats.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/datastore-side-scripting-can-prevent-bottlenecks/&quot;&gt;http://jaksprats.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/datastore-side-scripting-can-prevent-bottlenecks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a detailed high level description of all the things you could and should be monitoring look no further. Mathias Meyer has written a great article covering the different levels you probably want monitoring and why, along with reference to tools that fit that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/1/5/the_virtues_of_monitoring.html&quot;&gt;http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/1/5/the_virtues_of_monitoring.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook talking about scaling is always good and these take aways from a talk by Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, are interesting reading. It concentrates mainly on how to scale an organisation which I think is just as important as the technology side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/6/10/the-four-meta-secrets-of-scaling-at-facebook.html&quot;&gt;http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/6/10/the-four-meta-secrets-of-scaling-at-facebook.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LASIC&lt;/span&gt; is a language that facilitates creating and managing systems in a cloud environment. At the moment it only supports Amazon &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; but looks like it might be interesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/lasic/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/lasic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeAgent is a fast growing and hugely popular UK based startup obsessed with building fantastic online accounting software. We&amp;#8217;re a small team of smart people looking to hire productive Ruby and Rails developers in Edinburgh or Cambridge. You&amp;#8217;ll be working on adding and maintaining features for our existing applications and making sure our software scales up as we inevitably take over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeagentcentral.com/company/jobs&quot;&gt;http://www.freeagentcentral.com/company/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bin Weevils are looking for a new &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; developer/sysadmin to join the team and continue the development of our &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; backed flash-based game. Being able to handle things at extreme scale is kinda fun &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a quiet day that does less than 5,000 concurrent users and 10+ million hits on our servers (and that&amp;#8217;s a drop in the ocean compared to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; and other servers we run). New code is written in the Zend Framework, with use of Nginx, Memcache and also some Java servers. For sysadmin tasks, an appreciation of tools like Chef and Capistrano would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 5 &amp;#8211; 7th January 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the fifth instalment of Devops Weekly. Sorry for the slow start this year, I&amp;#8217;ve been a little busy getting the new year started (so still no &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; version, sorry). Luckily the internet has been busy too so here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ve been reading these past few weeks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off a few upcoming events. If you&amp;#8217;re in Paris the second devops meetup is scheduled for the 12th of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com/2011/paris-devops-meetup-2/&quot;&gt;http://lanyrd.com/2011/paris-devops-meetup-2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago a few days later on the 15th of January a Chef Hackathon is being held. This looks like a full day event and some of the Opscode folk are going to be going along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/devops/calendar/15648262/&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/devops/calendar/15648262/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interview with Adrian Cole about Jclouds (a Java library for interacting with cloud services like EC2) has a few interesting points. In particular the build in in-memory version of S3 especially for writing tests against is a nice idea. Worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/adrian-cole-jclouds&quot;&gt;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/adrian-cole-jclouds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next article shows a couple of approaches to having EC2 (or any cloud instance) automatically register with your puppetmaster. Good examples and good explanation of what you&amp;#8217;re doing and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codelord.net/2010/12/19/using-puppet-to-automatically-configure-new-ec2-instances/&quot;&gt;http://www.codelord.net/2010/12/19/using-puppet-to-automatically-configure-new-ec2-instances/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good lengthy walkthrough of starting out with Chef. If you&amp;#8217;ve been using Chef for a while it&amp;#8217;s easy to forget the initial barrier of getting going so I really liked the conversational style and personal experience approach to this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beacon.wharton.upenn.edu/404/2010/12/chef-out-of-the-gate/&quot;&gt;http://beacon.wharton.upenn.edu/404/2010/12/chef-out-of-the-gate/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; is probably one of the most useful and used tools in anyones toolbox and the number of tricks and features is surprisingly large. This ever growing blog post is documenting in an easy to read manner all manner of tips and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://crunchtools.com/ssh-keychain/&quot;&gt;http://crunchtools.com/ssh-keychain/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice folk at Etsy have open sourced an internal node.js tool they are using to collect and aggregate statistics. StatsD provides a very straightforward interface for collecting arbitrary stats and feeding them into Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/statsd&quot;&gt;https://github.com/etsy/statsd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m always interested in another continuos integration server and Big Tuna looks nice. It&amp;#8217;s a Rails based application, supports multiple version control systems and has a nice looking interface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 4 &amp;#8211; 21st December 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the fourth instalment of Devops Weekly. I&amp;#8217;ll probably be taking a break next week while I&amp;#8217;m on holiday, so the next issue should be available in the new year. As always email gareth@morethanseven.net if you have anything you&amp;#8217;d like included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Configuration Management DevRoom at Fosdem next year is looking for talks, anyone interested has until the 8th of January to submit. Presentations are to be formal and not longer than 30 minutes, plus 15 &lt;br /&gt;
extra for questions (45 in total). Panels with more than one speaker are also of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/call-for-papers-configuration-management-devroom-at-fosdem-2011/&quot;&gt;http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/call-for-papers-configuration-management-devroom-at-fosdem-2011/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be using either Glassfish or Puppet but I found this article interesting anyway as it&amp;#8217;s a good walk though of taking unpackaged software fresh from the developers and going through the steps of packaging and automating installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.screv.com/?p=143&quot;&gt;http://blog.screv.com/?p=143&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guys at Devstructure have made lots of changes to their service this week, including moving to a completely free model. It&amp;#8217;s an interesting approach to configuration management that&amp;#8217;s worth having a look at of you haven&amp;#8217;t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.devstructure.com/rebooting-devstructure&quot;&gt;http://blog.devstructure.com/rebooting-devstructure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel bad about including the next article as I wrote it, but I reason it&amp;#8217;s interesting to readers of devopsweekly. Even pushing down the time between releases doesn&amp;#8217;t remove all of the risk from rolling out new code, that&amp;#8217;s where smoke testing comes in. This article walks through an example using cucumber and celerity to do fast, headless, tests to check your deployment worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-17-smoke-testing-deployments-using.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-17-smoke-testing-deployments-using.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More headless testing, this time using the Jasmine &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BDD&lt;/span&gt; Javascript framework. This article shows how to wire up Rhino to allow you to run javascript tests without a browser, perfect for continuous integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agile.dzone.com/news/javascript-bdd-jasmine-without&quot;&gt;http://agile.dzone.com/news/javascript-bdd-jasmine-without&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mcollective, the build server orchestration or parallel job execution framework, has just released version 1.0.0. It comes with a few minor features and bug fixes but also marks a change in how the software packages will be made available and versioned in the future. Well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/mcollective-users/browse_thread/thread/9c548d321b159627&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/mcollective-users/browse_thread/thread/9c548d321b159627&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn recently released their deployment automation platform called Glu, which is used to deploy the various different parts of LinkedIn. It&amp;#8217;s written in groovy/java but can apparently be used to deploy anything.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 3 &amp;#8211; 14th December 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the third instalment of Devops Weekly. Thanks for all the support again this week. If you have any news or tools you think people will find interesting do email me at gareth@morethanseven.net&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Devops is definitely the adoption of agile practices by operations teams and it&amp;#8217;s interesting to read about about peoples experience of managing process in a team of systems administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rooflabs.com/2010/12/13/using-agile-to-manage-system-engineering/&quot;&gt;http://www.rooflabs.com/2010/12/13/using-agile-to-manage-system-engineering/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agile Web Operations blog has been putting out a series of Devops posts over the past couple of weeks. The first one this week that caught my eye was John Allspaw&amp;#8217;s post about soft skills and the importance of communication and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-these-soft-parts&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-these-soft-parts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second article is from James Turnbull on why people really shouldn&amp;#8217;t get hung up on the word Devops (as some people appear to do). &amp;#8220;The point is making Ops better – one step at a time – and in the process making our lives easier&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/the-state-of-devops&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/the-state-of-devops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably my favourite article of the week was this one, on the re-emergance of Systems Engineering as a discipline. I found lots of this described me and, I think, many of the people I meet at Devops events. It also neatly sidesteps the Devops as a role argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1149&quot;&gt;http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1149&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James talked in his article above about his formative years and another post this week caught my eye about experience gained working with smart people and processes. This one covers the importance of source control, staging servers and some lessons learned using them. Good introductory material is hard to write so I&amp;#8217;d love to see more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/12/12/staging-servers-source-control-deploy-workflows-and-other-stuff-nobody-teaches-you/&quot;&gt;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/12/12/staging-servers-source-control-deploy-workflows-and-other-stuff-nobody-teaches-you/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find people sharing details about the tools they use incredible useful, especially when they can include numbers. This great open blog post about using Bacula for backups is exactly the sort of thing I&amp;#8217;d like to see more of. &amp;#8220;A standard 2 week rotation amounts to ~190 TB of data con taining ~490.000.000 files&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.myunix.dk/2010/12/01/large-scale-disk-to-disk-backups-using-bacula/&quot;&gt;http://blog.myunix.dk/2010/12/01/large-scale-disk-to-disk-backups-using-bacula/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before I hit the send button Julian Simpson just published a good interview with the product manager of the Go continuous integration and deployment pipeline too from Thoughtworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.build-doctor.com/2010/12/14/go-thoughtworks-jez-humble/&quot;&gt;http://www.build-doctor.com/2010/12/14/go-thoughtworks-jez-humble/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself looking at different ways of aggregating log files from different systems this week and had chance to investigate a couple of newish open source offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graylog2 is a Java app which stores syslog entries in a MongoDB datastore, along with a good looking Ruby on Rails application for looking at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.graylog2.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.graylog2.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logstash is similar in purpose to Graylog2 but uses ElasticSearch as the backend. It can also aggregate logs from syslog, text files or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AMQP&lt;/span&gt; which might prove useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/logstash/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/logstash/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 2 &amp;#8211; 7th December 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the feedback since last week. I had a few issues with links being rewritten to be rather on the long side when the final newsletter was sent out. I was hoping to have time this week to get round to resolving but alas the week flew by. The same will happen again this time but I&amp;#8217;ve positioned the links after the text so it should be easier to read. I&amp;#8217;ll probably move to a very simple &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; format as time permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s December which means we have lots of blogs trying to publish a new article every day. One such blog that I found last year and is keeping up the high standard again is &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SYSADVENT&lt;/span&gt;. The pick of the articles for me so far has been this one, talking about using code reviews in operations teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-5-why-arent-you-doing-code-reviews.html&quot;&gt;http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-5-why-arent-you-doing-code-reviews.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People interested in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PERFORMANCE&lt;/span&gt; even have their own advent calendar blog, again publishing some really good content already. This article about the need for generalists within software teams I think runs parallel with many of the ideas of devops, at least as I see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2010/the-full-stack/&quot;&gt;http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2010/the-full-stack/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago now a group of about 35 London based developers and ops people met up to talk about &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DEPLOYMENT&lt;/span&gt;. The nice folks at YouDevise let us use a room in their offices and we had at it for a good few hours. The videos taken during the event have just been published and make an educational and occasionally entertaining watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.youdevise.com/YDBlog/index.php/2010/12/01/devops-comes-to-youdevise&quot;&gt;https://dev.youdevise.com/YDBlog/index.php/2010/12/01/devops-comes-to-youdevise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t a new article but I found it interesting coming from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GARTNER&lt;/span&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re working in a large enterprise it can often be tricky to get buy-in for new ideas or ways of working. Having large companies outside the technology sector as well as analyst firms advocating for some of the things we&amp;#8217;re all talking about can only be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.gartner.com/cameron_haight/2010/04/07/the-need-for-it-io-reform/&quot;&gt;http://blogs.gartner.com/cameron_haight/2010/04/07/the-need-for-it-io-reform/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Jones has put together a pretty comprehensive &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SURVEY&lt;/span&gt; around devops. We&amp;#8217;ve seen lots of people writing about what they think devops means, so it should be interested if enough people fill this out to see what a wider group think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekle.id.au/2010/12/devops-survey-2010.html&quot;&gt;http://www.geekle.id.au/2010/12/devops-survey-2010.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HUDSON&lt;/span&gt; project have been having some political issues of late and it&amp;#8217;s good to see them publishing regular updates to the wider community. Continuous Integration plays a big part in quite a few devops ideas and we need a mature open source player in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing&quot;&gt;http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MCOLLECTIVE&lt;/span&gt; has traditionally used ApacheMQ for it&amp;#8217;s messaging needs and several people (myself included) had enquired about whether it could work with RabbitMQ, especially for people that already had that message queue in a production environment. With recent patches to the Stomp adaptor for Rabbit, and this handy tutorial you should be up and running in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Issue 1 - 30th November 2010</title>
    <link href="http://devopsweekly.com/2010/11/30/issue-1/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://devopsweekly.com/2010/11/30/issue-1</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Issue 1 &amp;#8211; 30th November 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the first issue of Devops Weekly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been finding Ruby Weekly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyweekly.com/&quot;&gt;http://rubyweekly.com/&lt;/a&gt;), an email newsletter from Peter Cooper, increasingly useful in the last month or so. Something about finding a small amount of high quality content once a week easier to digest than the usual fire hose of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; and Twitter. So I&amp;#8217;m trying the same format out for devops related content. Please email me with anything you think is worth featuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is Devops? I know a number of people have signed up to this newsletter having only recently come across the term. It&amp;#8217;s safe to say Devops means different things to different people at this early stage, but I&amp;#8217;m going to start out by pointing everyone to James Turnbull&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WHAT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DEVOPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MEANS&lt;/span&gt; TO ME (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kartar.net/2010/02/what-devops-means-to-me/&quot;&gt;http://www.kartar.net/2010/02/what-devops-means-to-me/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The much loved &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VELOCITY&lt;/span&gt; conference has put out a call for participation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011/public/cfp/137&quot;&gt;http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011/public/cfp/137&lt;/a&gt;) for next year&amp;#8217;s event. You have until January 11th, 2011 to put together suggestions and submit them. In particular they are looking for talks and panels on NoSQL, mobile performance, effective cloud computing, javaScript speedups, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; optimizations, metrics and monitoring and the impact on the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Holmwood has written an interesting piece this week about all the things happening in Devops recently, in particular whether people are too focused on tools and technologies at the expense of people and communication (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-hijacked-by-technologists&quot;&gt;http://www.agileweboperations.com/devops-hijacked-by-technologists&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related topic Spike Morelli has been writing about the use of the term Devops and how it&amp;#8217;s a useful marketing phrase if we want to spread our experiments and ideas to a wider audience (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spikelab.org/the-word-devops-and-a-marketing-problem/&quot;&gt;http://www.spikelab.org/the-word-devops-and-a-marketing-problem/&lt;/a&gt;). This definitely gels with my own reasons for creating Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Heck just wrote about a new monitoring system he&amp;#8217;s been working on for a year called &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EYES&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2010/11/20/eyes-a-new-monitoring-system/&quot;&gt;http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2010/11/20/eyes-a-new-monitoring-system/&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#8217;s still early days but sounds interesting. The main thrust seems to be that having a monitoring system that is completely &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; driven from the start makes lots of things easier. It uses the Nagios plugin format as well so you should be able to make use of existing plugins easily enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve recently been playing with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUCUMER&lt;/span&gt; for monitoring purposes and it looks like others have too. Jordan Sissel just posted an example of using Cucumber to monitor a Solr instance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/707691&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/707691&lt;/a&gt;) that I found useful. If anyone else has any Cucumber scripts they use for monitoring purposes I&amp;#8217;d love to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One article I came across this week that I found particularly handy was a huge roundup of Linux &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MONITORING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UTILITIES&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/top-linux-monitoring-tools.html&quot;&gt;http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/top-linux-monitoring-tools.html&lt;/a&gt;). I&amp;#8217;d wager most readers will have come across most of the tools on the list but I found it interesting seeing them all listed in one place along with quick examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only came across &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VAGRANT&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://vagrantup.com/&quot;&gt;http://vagrantup.com/&lt;/a&gt;) at the recent devopsdays event in Hamburg but I&amp;#8217;m already finding it indispensable. Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments built around VirtualBox. In my view it massively reduces the barrier to entry for using virtualisation in even small development teams. Worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SCALE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CAMP&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scalecamp.org.uk/&quot;&gt;http://www.scalecamp.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;) is billed as a one-day event for and by people who care about web performance and scalability. It&amp;#8217;s being hosted in London at the offices of The Guardian and if last year&amp;#8217;s event was anything to go by should be a great opportunity to talk about interesting topics with smart people. For those not able to make it along I&amp;#8217;ll try and find as many write ups of the event for a future Devops Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well not really, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DEVOPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BOOKS&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsbooks.com/&quot;&gt;http://devopsbooks.com/&lt;/a&gt;) is another site I just launched collecting recommended reading for anyone interested in Devops topics. I&amp;#8217;m always looking for more book recommendations so please email me with anything I&amp;#8217;m missing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
